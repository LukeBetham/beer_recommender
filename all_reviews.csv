Faint chocolate/caramel aroma. Lowish+ carbonation. Whisky makes itself known, if somewhat plainly, with butterscotch and vanilla alongside some woody notes. The beer portion delivers typical McEwan's tangy dry tannins with a Marmite aspect (the yeast?), and a slight apple-esque fruity tinge. Really not bad, especially for the price on supermarket shelves, but it's no great shakes as a whisky beer either. No reason really to drink McEwan's Export over this.",LagerGuide122

Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

As with Kicker Pilsner, it's too sugary sweet for a pils. Mosaic makes it smell like an American IPA; I'm not really reminded of a German or Czech lager at all. Not that it smells bad...in fact, it's pretty clean and doesn't suffer the big onion stench that Mosaic IPAs usually have (just a small bit in the background). Kinda thin, watery, and fizzy. Overall drinkable, but disappointing since the brewery seems to have some potential (Quiet Depths is very nice, for example), but sadly this isn't a winner.",Ernest

Saints Row Grassroots,3.5,"Rockville, Maryland",Saints Row Brewing Company,"Poured from 12 oz. can. 

Clear, pale yellow with a 1-finger off-white head and fare lacing.  

Aroma of light citrus, white pepper and the Chesapeake Bay. 

Taste of light citrus, pilsner malt, white pepper, pineapple, calcium and brine. 

Medium body and medium carbonation. 

The addition of blue crab shells to the brew certainly had a profound effect. Upon opening the can, the aroma was immediately recognizable as a saison. Saison characteristics come through strongly in flavor as does pilsner malt. But, you can’t miss the Chesapeake shoreline one the aroma or the pleasant saltiness and calcium in the flavor. I would have like a little more wild yeast character typical of a saison, but this also has its appeal.",MadRobin

Coronado Shaka Berry,4.6,"Coronado, California",Coronado Brewing Company,"Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is crafted with boysenberry, blackberry, vanilla, cocoa, and lactose brewed by Coronado Brewing Company from Coronado, California.

The aroma of cocoa, boysenberries, blackberries, and lactose are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of khaki head. When held up to light, dark brown and carbonation are seen at the surface. Dark mahogany shows when light reflects off the beer. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

Chocolate is moderately rich to the body and tasted when you lick your chops. Cocoa accents the mouthfeel and slightly enriches the chocolate. Lactose lightens and smoothens the drink followed by a vanilla tone. Boysenberry flavors the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla complexion. Blackberries add to the berry sweetness and gently tarts the comprehension. Biscuit malt is discernible as the beer warms and tangible with the chocolate and lactose profile.

Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is glamorous. The chocolate, cocoa, lactose, vanilla, boysenberry, blackberry, and biscuit malt combine into a delightful craft beer. The cocoa gives the chocolate base a savory touch. The lactose and vanilla makes the beer incredibly easy to drink. The sweetness of the boysenberries and blackberries are overpowered by the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla composition. I loved drinking this brew and impressed with this interpretation of a pasty stout.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Epic Big Bad Baptist - Quintuple Barrel,4.4,"Salt Lake City, Utah",Epic Brewing Company (UT/CO),"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, frothy, mocha-colored head. Smells rather intoxicating of quite roasted, caramel malt, dark, bitter chocolate and coffee and lighter coconut, toffee and vanilla, as well as some oak and brandy/bourbon accents. Taste is an excellent balance of quite roasted, slightly caramelly malt, a huge dark, bitter and roasted chocolate and coffee presence, with the chocolate feeling even more prominent, and ligher notes of toasted coconut, almonds, licorice and vanilla, as well as a strong barrel presence of both brandy and bourbon, with the brandy feeling a little prominent, some oak and a good dose of salted caramel coming through in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, coconut and salted caramel lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.

This is just a fantastic stout with a huge depth of flavor and complexity, while still being superbly balanced, with quite a roasted and bitter character and only very little sweetness being provided by the salted caramel here. The huge dark and bitter chocolate and coffee notes play right into this balance with a very rich presence and the coffee also providing subtle spicy accents, while the toasted coconut and almonds actually remain firmly in the background, with the coconut coming through a little more though, while also feeling rather toasted and not as sweet as in some stouts. The rich barrel profile really is the coup de grace here though, with the brandy coming through particularly with a sort of fruity, mildly sweet and boozy presence along with the more typical bourbon barrel notes of oak and vanilla. Mind you, I'm not a huge fan of sweet and boozy stouts at all and these brandy notes are rather soft and subtle here, working well with the overall balance. I often find these 650ml bottles of 12+% ABV stout overwhelming and difficult to finish, but I will be savoring every last drop of this.",snowcrash000

Tangy dark and dried fruits are the star of the show here, raisin and even cherry make themselves known, and are lifted up somewhat with a beleaguered toffee malt. Has a sort of Marmite on toast character, what with the tangy fruit elements and slight dry tannins. If you squint there's even a woody note in here. Not bad at all, and great bang for your buck ABV-wise on supermarket shelves - if that's a concern for you! No alcohol burn.

Trillium plane over car over train over boat,3.7,"Boston, Massachusetts",Trillium Brewing Company,"'Quadrupel IPA' of the hazy kind by NEIPA's grandmasters in Boston, Massachusetts; can from De Hopduvel.  Thinnish and immediately open, egg-white, irregular, lightly lacing head on a deeply cloudy peach-orange blonde beer, looking a bit like passionfruit juice from a jar.  Aroma of blood orange juice, passionfruit, overripe papaja, mango, Screwdriver, diesel, gin, hints of pink peppercorns, green olives, soggy biscuit, limoncello, lime peel, lemon verbena.  Sweet onset with light sourish touch, a huge wave of passionfruit-, papaja- and mango-like tropical juiciness with a refreshingly citrusy blood orange effect at the sides, gently carbonated with full, soft body.  Cake-doughy and biscuity malts completely overwhelmed by juicy, tropical hoppiness, sweet mango, papaja and passionfruit again with that orangey side, followed by a wodka-like alcohol glow as well as some overripe onion- and even diesel-like dankness.  Enormously juicy and tropical, this tastes more like tropical fruit juice spiked with wodka than like beer - which for me is too cocktail-like.  Could use a bit more citric zestiness and hop bitterness (not too much of course - we are still talking NEIPA here) to bring this tropical fruit cocktail effect into balance.  Not Trillium's most complex or impressive hazy IPA so far for me, but still an interesting one, venturing into extreme 'tropicality' and pushing the boundaries of the hazy IPA idiom when it comes to alcohol strength; I'm sure all those young haze geeks out there will love this.",Alengrin

Appearance: Pleasantly, responsibly hazy, light yellow-orange in color with an inch of soft-looking, white foam.

Smell: Citrusy, lightly tropical aroma with white grapefruit and a snap of tangerine aided by pineapple and a thin sliver of mango. Modest maltiness with a subtle showing of rustic raw grains.

Taste: Light-leaning malt profile, a nibble of humble cracker with the merest kiss of sweetness. It quickly dries out, with measured citrus fruits backed by lesser tropical notes and a nice awakening acidity. Tiny bit of biting rind. Bitterness, overall, feels really mellow. Ultra faint oat creaminess felt on the swallow.

Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.0,"Freising, Bavaria",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,"1 pint 0.9 oz. bottle

AROMA:  Sweet with scents of apricot, banana, bubblegum and undertones of lemon.

APPEARANCE:  Pours a hazy light-gold with a frothy white head that dissipates slowly.

TASTE:  Softly sweet with flavors of banana and a hint of cloves.

MOUTHFEEL:  Medium-bodied with a slightly slick, but sticky texture.  Carbonation is mild.  There is a hint of soft-bitterness in the finish.

OVERALL:  I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised with its overall ""softness"".  And by that I mean, in all aspects (feel, taste, smell, etc.) the attributes always maintained a nice balance and never underwhelmed (e.g. needing to strain your senses just to detect something), nor overwhelmed (e.g. having your senses inflicted with blunt-force trauma).  Additionally, I found that the flavor of this beer doesn't really change much as it warms to room temperature.  To me, that is impressive, as I've found that most sweet-ish beers tend to get much sweeter as they warm.  All-in-all, I can't really find anything to complain about other than I don't have another one waiting for me in the fridge.",ironprog

La Rulles Cré Tonnerre,3.0,"Rulles, Belgium",Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles,"Copenhagen 26/4 2020. 75 cl capped bottle from Belgisk Bryg, Emdrup Mosevej, Kbh NV. A merry band, music playing pirates on the label. Shall dark rum for all time be associated with Captain Morgan?

Pours unclear, golden yellow with a big fluffy white head. Fairly stable. Settles as thin layer of foam just covering the surface of the beer. Crawling up the side of the glass. Substantial lacing. 

Aroma is moderately intense with a sweet, malty odor with  very light touch of rum. Caramel, toffee, butter. Light odor of sweet, dark alcohol chiming in. 

Light carbonation. Slightly thick, oily, almost flat texture. 

Flavor is medium intense and has a fairly strong sweetness followed by a moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and lingers for a bit. Tepid finish. 

Not  bad beer. But a bit of an exaggeration to call this a ""Bière au Rhum"". I would rather call it a very malty brew with a faint tang of rum. Can hardly justify the band of merry pirates on the label.",DraftDodger

The taste is crisp, dry, light bitterness, pithy, soda water with orange peel, kind of soapy, pine and grass with a dry, rindy finish. Light body and moderate, prickly carbonation.

13.8%ABV bottled 20SEPT18
Pitch black, opaque, small tan head persists.
Aroma is very roasty; blackened toast, coffee grounds, cacoa nibs, oaken vanilla, old wood, lots of spice & dried fruits.
Thick body, oily, rather boozy, low carbonation, not hugely thick despite the weight of it.
A mish-mash of things going on; not a great clarity of flavours - oaken vanilla pretty big, as is bitter chocolate maltiness, toasty waffle (bourbon barrel) character, dried fruits; more emerges as it warms, yet still a bit all over the shop despite its age - good whack of booze, fairly bitter.
Seems to tick a heap of boxes, but seems to lack the finesse & polished quality of the best beers of this style - still, very bloody good!",Muggus69

Odd Breed Wild Ales In Memoriam,3.3,"Pompano Beach, Florida",Odd Breed Wild Ales,"750 mL bottle.  Clear golden with a big white head that dissipates quickly.  Smells of oak, lemon acidity, and grassy hops.  Tastes of the grassy and lightly skunky hops up front with a sharp lemony acidity.  Oak really takes over or maybe it just makes the hops seem chewier and grassier.  Astringent and oaky back end.  Moderate sourness, not quite as high as other Odd Breeds. After letting it warm a bit, some malt flavors open up, but the hops remain the single dominant flavor.

It's black, opaque, small tan head hangs around for a bit.
Aroma is richly roasty; burnt meat, toast, blackened things, deep roast coffee, cocoa, Porty undertones suggesting a big booze without giving away too much.
Reasonably thick, slick, slightly warming palate but really doesn't give the indication of how bloody strong it is!!
Very malty - lots of like burnt biscuit and blackened bread crust, fairly high bitterness, raisins, cocoa, coffee grinds....all like a distraction to the elephant in the room that this beer is potentially a fortified wine! But yes, you get booozy warmth on the finish, fair bitterness too; but it's no different from what you'd get from a 12% beer!

Untitled Art / Speciation Michelada,2.8,"Waunakee, Wisconsin",Untitled Art,"16 ounce can

I'm not sure why I picked up this single but the strange blend of flavors put me off any future micheladas. Perhaps it would have been better if I could have split it multiple ways just so I didn't have to endure eight ounces. 

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A rich coppery foundation supports a pillar of sticky head. Spicy tomato, malt, and herbs stray dangerously close to the territory of beers like Short's ill fated pizza experiment. In fact it almost resembles carbonated V8.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Tomato, spice, and a biting bubbly feel shock the palate to attention. The sharp transition then cuts over to a finish centered around malts. A mediocre experience from start to finish offers little excitement and nothing compelling past the first few sips.",Brigadier
Bell's III: O Captain! My Captain! (Leaves of Grass Series),3.4,"Comstock, Michigan",Bell's Brewery,"12 ounce bottle

Whenever a brewery like Bell's begins a new series it catches my eye. This polished lager met most expectations even though stylistically it might not be my favorite. I'll have to see if I can find any similar beers for comparison's sake.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A mahogany body gleams with a soft inner warmth. Licorice, malt, and a sprinkling of ash sweeten the air with a profile that was initially unexpected.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Chewy half melted chocolate bars, ash, and anise cool the tongue. The transition eases into a dense woody profile that centers around malt. Traces of coffee add a unique twist to the gentle finish. While hard to pin down this does enough to be a worthwhile session offering.",Brigadier

O'so 2 Milkshake Lunch,3.7,"Plover, Wisconsin",O'so Brewing Company,"16 ounce can

An amped up milkshake IPA takes everything except the bitterness to the next level. As a result it offers a filling and heady experience that provides a regional take on the popular style.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vanilla yogurt, creamy malt balls, and a doughy haze stick in the air with a foggy profile. From within the dense bronze base the lean ivory head surges upwards before collapsing after a minute or two.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Fruity notes amplify and double down the intensity that centers around a core of fresh yeast, light chocolate, and citrus. The transition takes on the character of velvet cake which lingers into the chewy finish. As a change of pace from their sours this might be one of my favorite O'so releases in recent memory.",Brigadier

Karben4 Champagne Tortoise,3.5,"Madison, Wisconsin",Karben4 Brewing,"12 ounce bottle

A benchmark beer for Karben4, this English style mild ale gets the job done in typical fashion for the brewery with an on the nose profile and little extra. It might not be standout but if you're seeking a regional Midwest take on an old world style then it should suffice.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Moderately toasted wheat bread splashed with melted Hershey's kisses pair well with the dry mellow hops. The rich brown base supports a lean ivory head that is laid back and subtle.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Malty toast tickles the tongue with a splash of noble hops. The light refreshing mouthfeel gives way to the gentle finish.

I was really curious to try my first Pale Ale from Adroit Theory since all those double-digit abv beers I had so far from them (Barley Wines, Quadrupels, Impy Stouts) were really outstanding and showed a unique and typical character that mark this brewery. Here I find again high drinkability, which has been a constant factor in all Adroit brews, but neither an intensity of hop flavours nor anything else in unknown quality to push the rating score on a top level. No disappointment, but nothing special either.",Idiosynkrasie

Erdinger Weissbier,2.9,"Erding, Bavaria",Erdinger Weissbräu,"(500ml bottle, Berlin. 25 Apr 2020)
AROMA: light grain/wheat, yeast, biscuit, some perfume, not much of the banana/cloves that some wheat beers have
APPEARANCE: tall white head, hazy dirty yellow, foam does linger and leaves a fair amount of residual
TASTE: tastes like a hearty lager, grainy, green, grassy, leaning towards non-roasted grain/wheat, a hint of citrus at first but builds up as the beer warms up, some coffee hidden underneath on the finish, 
PALATE: quite sparkly and fizzy, so a bit biting on the front with fizz persisting for a bit. approaching medium body, after the sharpness, there is some roundness and oiliness,  

OVERALL: nose is light and underwhelming but nuanced, good looking beer, mouth feel is a bit too sharp for me, flavors focus on citrus and grass and light grain. It is a quality beer that tastes like it was made well, but the bite/astringency is a tad too much for me. As it warms up and flattens out, it does get better.",Rex_Remes

There is a decent piney fresh citrus vibe here but it plays second fiddle to a slightly savoury green hop vibe, not filthy but suppressing the natural fruity hop brightness of this stellar trio. Perhaps this is the same batch of Citra that Cloudwater recently showcased and was too dirty for my liking. A bit more of that almost Candy Idaho 7 fruitiness on the end but Sabro is only a light presence. Good but not the stellar hop treat I was expecting.",madmitch76

Shepherd Neame India Pale Ale (Bottle),4.1,"Faversham, Kent",Shepherd Neame,"500ml bottle brewed in England at 6.1%. Clear metallic amber bronze, with a large, solid head. Aroma of caramel and slight earth. Lowish+ carbonation. Classic earthy Fuggles with a splash of citrus and apple. Fairly well-hopped for its supermarket price point, but won't really please someone looking for an American-style IPA! Pale caramel malt joins and completes the affair. Really not bad, for all its simplicity. It's not quite Fuller's Bengal Lancer, but then again, it's not pretending to be, and is a fair bit cheaper too. This is sort of the English equivalent of classic German beer, just...English, and ale. Has that typical Shepherd Neame taste to it. Fans of the brewery will like this, as will most who give it a fair shot. If you don't like Shepherd Neame style beers, though, you won't like this.",LagerGuide122

Let's just try to keep this in perspective. This pours pretty regularly, a slightly hazy brassy color under a foamy head. Smell is mostly hop bitterness. Any impressions from fresh northwestern hops would have dissipated, but what's left behind is still pretty hoppy.

Lion Bridge Gazprom Double Maple,4.2,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa",Lion Bridge Brewing Company,"12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Potent, unmistakable Pancake House syrupy smell at arm's length, with malted milk balls, something sort of marshmallowy, caramel, vanilla, wood smoke, candied plums and light roast. Awesome awesome. Pours oily black with one finger of creamy chocolate head that dissolves to a thin cover in a few minutes. Complex flavor profile that evolves from one sip to the next: Big hit of maple up front with chocolate and caramel around the mid-palate, long finish with ripe fruit and medium-roast and a flash of heat as the big ABV hits bottom. Full-bodied, but easier to drink than you'd think at first, sweet and sticky on the gums and back of the throat as you'd expect. Managed to get my hands on this unexpectedly just about a month after I tried its little brother, and I'm sure glad I did. The two experiences couldn't be more different. Double Maple is a big beer, and quite sweet, and although the maple is a consistent throughout, the other flavors fluctuate in surprising ways I associate with some of the best stouts out there.

Taste favors the herbal, grassy, dank hops and the fruity citrus in the aroma turns into citrus peel. Overtly bitter all the way through the finish, subdued sweetness and light floral notes.",stevoj

Brick (UK) Coconut DIPA,4.2,"Deptford, Greater London",Brick Brewery (UK),"September 16, 2019 - At The Rake, on draught.  Looks like a NEIPA - quite hazy/cloudy light gold with an okay fizzy white head.  Aroma is a solid apricot/floral East Coast DIPA with an overlay of toasted coconut, restrained alcohol for a DIPA.  The taste, however - wow - toasted coconut that doesn't over whelm the fruity/floral huge malt body, biggish alcohol, but it just works so well - wonderfully balanced, actuall brought a grin on as I drank it - so good, one of the beers of the trip and it's a crime nobody else on RB had this (I had to create the entry) - this is deserving of another brew, although it's probably a PITA to make, based on what brewers have said about working with coconut in the past.  Solid body, perfect keg carbonation, medium non-coating finish with a long ride-out of toasted coconut and floral bitterness.

Parish Pure Tropics,4.1,"Broussard, Louisiana",Parish Brewing Company,"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy, straw golden color and topped by a small off white layer of foam that settles quickly to a thin film. The aroma bursts with tropical fruit notes of juicy pineapple, mango, and guava which play nicely with the underlying orange and grapefruit notes from the hops with pale and biscuit malts providing the back drop. The flavor follows suit with notes of juicy pineapple, mango, and pink guava right up front and backed up the pale malts and a firm  balancing hop bitterness on the back end. Medium bodied with ample carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet and tropical fruit finish with lingering notes of pineapple and mango.

Outer Range Jerry Juice,3.0,"Frisco, Colorado",Outer Range Brewing,"Can.

Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is light yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (flowers, blueberry, orange, mango), with a hint of onion.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

As with Kicker Pilsner, it's too sugary sweet for a pils. Mosaic makes it smell like an American IPA; I'm not really reminded of a German or Czech lager at all. Not that it smells bad...in fact, it's pretty clean and doesn't suffer the big onion stench that Mosaic IPAs usually have (just a small bit in the background). Kinda thin, watery, and fizzy. Overall drinkable, but disappointing since the brewery seems to have some potential (Quiet Depths is very nice, for example), but sadly this isn't a winner.",Ernest

Coronado Shaka Berry,4.6,"Coronado, California",Coronado Brewing Company,"Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is crafted with boysenberry, blackberry, vanilla, cocoa, and lactose brewed by Coronado Brewing Company from Coronado, California.

The aroma of cocoa, boysenberries, blackberries, and lactose are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of khaki head. When held up to light, dark brown and carbonation are seen at the surface. Dark mahogany shows when light reflects off the beer. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

Chocolate is moderately rich to the body and tasted when you lick your chops. Cocoa accents the mouthfeel and slightly enriches the chocolate. Lactose lightens and smoothens the drink followed by a vanilla tone. Boysenberry flavors the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla complexion. Blackberries add to the berry sweetness and gently tarts the comprehension. Biscuit malt is discernible as the beer warms and tangible with the chocolate and lactose profile.

Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is glamorous. The chocolate, cocoa, lactose, vanilla, boysenberry, blackberry, and biscuit malt combine into a delightful craft beer. The cocoa gives the chocolate base a savory touch. The lactose and vanilla makes the beer incredibly easy to drink. The sweetness of the boysenberries and blackberries are overpowered by the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla composition. I loved drinking this brew and impressed with this interpretation of a pasty stout.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Epic Big Bad Baptist - Quintuple Barrel,4.4,"Salt Lake City, Utah",Epic Brewing Company (UT/CO),"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, frothy, mocha-colored head. Smells rather intoxicating of quite roasted, caramel malt, dark, bitter chocolate and coffee and lighter coconut, toffee and vanilla, as well as some oak and brandy/bourbon accents. Taste is an excellent balance of quite roasted, slightly caramelly malt, a huge dark, bitter and roasted chocolate and coffee presence, with the chocolate feeling even more prominent, and ligher notes of toasted coconut, almonds, licorice and vanilla, as well as a strong barrel presence of both brandy and bourbon, with the brandy feeling a little prominent, some oak and a good dose of salted caramel coming through in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, coconut and salted caramel lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.

This is just a fantastic stout with a huge depth of flavor and complexity, while still being superbly balanced, with quite a roasted and bitter character and only very little sweetness being provided by the salted caramel here. The huge dark and bitter chocolate and coffee notes play right into this balance with a very rich presence and the coffee also providing subtle spicy accents, while the toasted coconut and almonds actually remain firmly in the background, with the coconut coming through a little more though, while also feeling rather toasted and not as sweet as in some stouts. The rich barrel profile really is the coup de grace here though, with the brandy coming through particularly with a sort of fruity, mildly sweet and boozy presence along with the more typical bourbon barrel notes of oak and vanilla. Mind you, I'm not a huge fan of sweet and boozy stouts at all and these brandy notes are rather soft and subtle here, working well with the overall balance. I often find these 650ml bottles of 12+% ABV stout overwhelming and difficult to finish, but I will be savoring every last drop of this.",snowcrash000

Light carbonation. Slightly thick, sticky, almost flat texture. 

Flavor is intense with a strong sweetness followed by a medium strong bitterness (a bit surprising when I take the aroma into account). Aftertaste is sweetish with a bitter undercurrent. Lingers for a while. Finish is semi-dry.

Toffee aroma with a hint of sultana (and maybe even minute sulphur?). Lowish carbonation, but feels muted due to the fairly thick consistency. Tangy dark and dried fruits are the star of the show here, raisin and even cherry make themselves known, and are lifted up somewhat with a beleaguered toffee malt. Has a sort of Marmite on toast character, what with the tangy fruit elements and slight dry tannins. If you squint there's even a woody note in here. Not bad at all, and great bang for your buck ABV-wise on supermarket shelves - if that's a concern for you! No alcohol burn. Interesting and decent; fairly complex, and a decided step or three above McEwan's Export.",LagerGuide122

Thinnish and immediately open, egg-white, irregular, lightly lacing head on a deeply cloudy peach-orange blonde beer, looking a bit like passionfruit juice from a jar.  Aroma of blood orange juice, passionfruit, overripe papaja, mango, Screwdriver, diesel, gin, hints of pink peppercorns, green olives, soggy biscuit, limoncello, lime peel, lemon verbena.  Sweet onset with light sourish touch, a huge wave of passionfruit-, papaja- and mango-like tropical juiciness with a refreshingly citrusy blood orange effect at the sides, gently carbonated with full, soft body.  Cake-doughy and biscuity malts completely overwhelmed by juicy, tropical hoppiness, sweet mango, papaja and passionfruit again with that orangey side, followed by a wodka-like alcohol glow as well as some overripe onion- and even diesel-like dankness.  Enormously juicy and tropical, this tastes more like tropical fruit juice spiked with wodka than like beer - which for me is too cocktail-like.  Could use a bit more citric zestiness and hop bitterness (not too much of course - we are still talking NEIPA here) to bring this tropical fruit cocktail effect into balance.  Not Trillium's most complex or impressive hazy IPA so far for me, but still an interesting one, venturing into extreme 'tropicality' and pushing the boundaries of the hazy IPA idiom when it comes to alcohol strength; I'm sure all those young haze geeks out there will love this.",Alengrin

CANNED ON: 03/24/20.

Appearance: Pleasantly, responsibly hazy, light yellow-orange in color with an inch of soft-looking, white foam.

Smell: Citrusy, lightly tropical aroma with white grapefruit and a snap of tangerine aided by pineapple and a thin sliver of mango. Modest maltiness with a subtle showing of rustic raw grains.

Taste: Light-leaning malt profile, a nibble of humble cracker with the merest kiss of sweetness. It quickly dries out, with measured citrus fruits backed by lesser tropical notes and a nice awakening acidity. Tiny bit of biting rind. Bitterness, overall, feels really mellow. Ultra faint oat creaminess felt on the swallow.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.0,"Freising, Bavaria",Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,"1 pint 0.9 oz. bottle

AROMA:  Sweet with scents of apricot, banana, bubblegum and undertones of lemon.

APPEARANCE:  Pours a hazy light-gold with a frothy white head that dissipates slowly.

TASTE:  Softly sweet with flavors of banana and a hint of cloves.

MOUTHFEEL:  Medium-bodied with a slightly slick, but sticky texture.  Carbonation is mild.  There is a hint of soft-bitterness in the finish.

OVERALL:  I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised with its overall ""softness"".  And by that I mean, in all aspects (feel, taste, smell, etc.) the attributes always maintained a nice balance and never underwhelmed (e.g. needing to strain your senses just to detect something), nor overwhelmed (e.g. having your senses inflicted with blunt-force trauma).  Additionally, I found that the flavor of this beer doesn't really change much as it warms to room temperature.  To me, that is impressive, as I've found that most sweet-ish beers tend to get much sweeter as they warm.  All-in-all, I can't really find anything to complain about other than I don't have another one waiting for me in the fridge.",ironprog

Aroma is moderately intense with a sweet, malty odor with  very light touch of rum. Caramel, toffee, butter. Light odor of sweet, dark alcohol chiming in. 

Light carbonation. Slightly thick, oily, almost flat texture. 

Flavor is medium intense and has a fairly strong sweetness followed by a moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and lingers for a bit. Tepid finish. 

Not  bad beer. But a bit of an exaggeration to call this a ""Bière au Rhum"". I would rather call it a very malty brew with a faint tang of rum. Can hardly justify the band of merry pirates on the label.",DraftDodger

Thick body, oily, rather boozy, low carbonation, not hugely thick despite the weight of it.
A mish-mash of things going on; not a great clarity of flavours - oaken vanilla pretty big, as is bitter chocolate maltiness, toasty waffle (bourbon barrel) character, dried fruits; more emerges as it warms, yet still a bit all over the shop despite its age - good whack of booze, fairly bitter.

Oak really takes over or maybe it just makes the hops seem chewier and grassier.  Astringent and oaky back end.  Moderate sourness, not quite as high as other Odd Breeds.

Aroma is richly roasty; burnt meat, toast, blackened things, deep roast coffee, cocoa, Porty undertones suggesting a big booze without giving away too much.
Reasonably thick, slick, slightly warming palate but really doesn't give the indication of how bloody strong it is!!
Very malty - lots of like burnt biscuit and blackened bread crust, fairly high bitterness, raisins, cocoa, coffee grinds....all like a distraction to the elephant in the room that this beer is potentially a fortified wine!

3 Sons Excuse My French Toast,3.3,"Dania Beach, Florida",3 Sons Brewing Company,"16 oz can.  Pours nearly pitch black in color and topped by a small tan layer of foam that fades away quickly to a thin film and leaves some patches of lace around the glass.  The aroma is all maple syrup sweetness here along with lighter notes of dark chocolate and cinnamon over a lightly roasted malt base, but the maple syrup takes center stage.  The flavor follows and is again loaded up front with the maple syrup sweetness, some lighter notes of dark chocolate, and just a touch of roast and bitterness on the back end.  Medium bodied and sticky sweet with moderate carbonation that leads to a heavily cloying maple syrup, light dark chocolate, and a touch of roast on the finish.  The sugary sweetness from the maple lingers long after the finish.  Nice concept, but just way too heavy handed with the maple syrup.",juiceisloose

Lingering mossy astringency on the top of the tongue in the finish. Good effervescence. Only ~7% ABV, but it gives a boozier impression.

Untitled Art / Speciation Michelada,2.8,"Waunakee, Wisconsin",Untitled Art,"16 ounce can

I'm not sure why I picked up this single but the strange blend of flavors put me off any future micheladas. Perhaps it would have been better if I could have split it multiple ways just so I didn't have to endure eight ounces. 

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A rich coppery foundation supports a pillar of sticky head. Spicy tomato, malt, and herbs stray dangerously close to the territory of beers like Short's ill fated pizza experiment. In fact it almost resembles carbonated V8.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Tomato, spice, and a biting bubbly feel shock the palate to attention. The sharp transition then cuts over to a finish centered around malts. A mediocre experience from start to finish offers little excitement and nothing compelling past the first few sips.",Brigadier
Bell's III: O Captain! My Captain! (Leaves of Grass Series),3.4,"Comstock, Michigan",Bell's Brewery,"12 ounce bottle

Whenever a brewery like Bell's begins a new series it catches my eye. This polished lager met most expectations even though stylistically it might not be my favorite. I'll have to see if I can find any similar beers for comparison's sake.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A mahogany body gleams with a soft inner warmth. Licorice, malt, and a sprinkling of ash sweeten the air with a profile that was initially unexpected.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Chewy half melted chocolate bars, ash, and anise cool the tongue. The transition eases into a dense woody profile that centers around malt. Traces of coffee add a unique twist to the gentle finish. While hard to pin down this does enough to be a worthwhile session offering.",Brigadier
Wild Ambition Ulpia Severina,3.9,"Kelowna, British Columbia",Wild Ambition Brewing,"Bottle from Legacy. Pinkish-purple colour with no head. On the nose, it's showing a lot of tartness and bright plum character. The tartness is deep and lactic, but there's a fair bit of fruit sweetness to help cut it. Bright plum. Decent body.

O'so 2 Milkshake Lunch,3.7,"Plover, Wisconsin",O'so Brewing Company,"16 ounce can

An amped up milkshake IPA takes everything except the bitterness to the next level. As a result it offers a filling and heady experience that provides a regional take on the popular style.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vanilla yogurt, creamy malt balls, and a doughy haze stick in the air with a foggy profile. From within the dense bronze base the lean ivory head surges upwards before collapsing after a minute or two.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Fruity notes amplify and double down the intensity that centers around a core of fresh yeast, light chocolate, and citrus. The transition takes on the character of velvet cake which lingers into the chewy finish. As a change of pace from their sours this might be one of my favorite O'so releases in recent memory.",Brigadier

Another gorgeous cask pour - clear copper-amber with a decent lasting creamy beige/tan head.  However ... the aroma is trying for floral/biscuit classic bitter character but it's a bit of an unpleasant mess - harsh, diacetyl and even a bit boozy for a bitter.

Just ... no.",HogTownHarry
Karben4 Champagne Tortoise,3.5,"Madison, Wisconsin",Karben4 Brewing,"12 ounce bottle

A benchmark beer for Karben4, this English style mild ale gets the job done in typical fashion for the brewery with an on the nose profile and little extra. It might not be standout but if you're seeking a regional Midwest take on an old world style then it should suffice.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Moderately toasted wheat bread splashed with melted Hershey's kisses pair well with the dry mellow hops. The rich brown base supports a lean ivory head that is laid back and subtle.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Malty toast tickles the tongue with a splash of noble hops. The light refreshing mouthfeel gives way to the gentle finish. While it lacks that something extra that sets apart a great mild from an average one it still has enough presence to be enjoyable to the end. Overall this felt like a nice diversion for one evening.",Brigadier

Slightly sweet yeast smell with spice consistent with Belgian ale, but not strong. Equal pleasing and symmetric taste, but clove/spice very subtle and not appreciable to me.

Sweet orange, light tart / zesty lime.  Blood one comes through nicely and works well for this type of beer.  ABV is completely hidden here, basically tastes like if you squeezed a couple of limes into a glass of orange juice.  Tingly, just tart enough to balance the sweetness.  Gimmick beer for sure, but a gimmick beer well done.

Erdinger Weissbier,2.9,"Erding, Bavaria",Erdinger Weissbräu,"(500ml bottle, Berlin. 25 Apr 2020)
AROMA: light grain/wheat, yeast, biscuit, some perfume, not much of the banana/cloves that some wheat beers have
APPEARANCE: tall white head, hazy dirty yellow, foam does linger and leaves a fair amount of residual
TASTE: tastes like a hearty lager, grainy, green, grassy, leaning towards non-roasted grain/wheat, a hint of citrus at first but builds up as the beer warms up, some coffee hidden underneath on the finish, 
PALATE: quite sparkly and fizzy, so a bit biting on the front with fizz persisting for a bit. approaching medium body, after the sharpness, there is some roundness and oiliness,  

OVERALL: nose is light and underwhelming but nuanced, good looking beer, mouth feel is a bit too sharp for me, flavors focus on citrus and grass and light grain. It is a quality beer that tastes like it was made well, but the bite/astringency is a tad too much for me. As it warms up and flattens out, it does get better.",Rex_Remes

Zapach: wyraźnie słodki profil; cytryna, limonka, grejpfrut, pomarańcza, zdaje się, że również ananas. Delikatnie wyczuwalna mleczność. Mam wrażenie, że w tle majaczy jakiś nieprzyjemny, starociowy aromat.

Smak: z początku trochę kwaśne, taka cytrynowa, limonkowa kwaśność. Dalej jednak bardziej cierpkie niż kwaśne. Finisz wytrawny. Charakter całości zdecydowanie cytrusowy, trochę tutaj jakby ananasa. Plus mam podobnie poczucie co w kwestii zapachu, jest tutaj coś dziwnego.

Odczucie w ustach: wysycenie średnie. Średnia treściwość. Goryczka na dość wysokim poziomie, o grejpfrutowym profilu.

Całość: mój główny zarzut do tego piwa to zdecydowanie zbyt mała kwaśność. Mam wrażenie, że charakter piwa w większej mierze jest cierpki, gorzki, limonkowy, natomiast kwaśność jest dość wygładzona. Brakuje również wyższego wysycenia. Na plus fajny, cytrusowy profil i dość wysoka goryczka.",bigbywolf

Can. Hazy gold beer, small bubbly pale cream colour head. Light palate, very light for the abv, a mild dryness, decent fine carbonation. Light malts, reasonably smooth and proving just enough sweetness for this tipa. The guava comes through, loud and clear and fruity fresh, nicely balanced by grapefruit that isn't too sharp. The Sabro is underneath but adds to the fruity complexity, the pineapple more noticeable here than the modest coconut. Modest pine streak.  Touches of fresh orange and orange peel on the light smooth finish that also shows modest hop spice. Dangerously drinkable due to its lightness and delightful fruitiness.",madmitch76

Shepherd Neame India Pale Ale (Bottle),4.1,"Faversham, Kent",Shepherd Neame,"500ml bottle brewed in England at 6.1%. Clear metallic amber bronze, with a large, solid head. Aroma of caramel and slight earth. Lowish+ carbonation. Classic earthy Fuggles with a splash of citrus and apple. Fairly well-hopped for its supermarket price point, but won't really please someone looking for an American-style IPA! Pale caramel malt joins and completes the affair. Really not bad, for all its simplicity. It's not quite Fuller's Bengal Lancer, but then again, it's not pretending to be, and is a fair bit cheaper too. This is sort of the English equivalent of classic German beer, just...English, and ale. Has that typical Shepherd Neame taste to it. Fans of the brewery will like this, as will most who give it a fair shot. If you don't like Shepherd Neame style beers, though, you won't like this.",LagerGuide122

Pours oily black with one finger of creamy chocolate head that dissolves to a thin cover in a few minutes.

Full-bodied, but easier to drink than you'd think at first, sweet and sticky on the gums and back of the throat as you'd expect. Managed to get my hands on this unexpectedly just about a month after I tried its little brother, and I'm sure glad I did. The two experiences couldn't be more different. Double Maple is a big beer, and quite sweet, and although the maple is a consistent throughout, the other flavors fluctuate in surprising ways I associate with some of the best stouts out there.

Slightly pungent, almost unctuous, yet rather likable bleu cheese note. It has that austere rustic vibe, but also a touch of peachy delicacy. Splash of perry through the drying finish.

19 Crimes Pale Ale,2.8,"Napa, California",19 Crimes Winery (Brewery),"375mL can from Ritchies IGA Maffra
4.4%ABV BB 26/02/21
Straw coloured brew, slight haze, firm fluffy head is retained.
Modest aroma - lemony, floral sort of hops, touch of grainy malt, slight fermentation esters/fruitiness.
Plenty of carbonation, rather thin, medium-ish weight, very dry.
Offers very little on the body - a suggestion of cereal malt, even less of a suggestion of that floral citrus sort of hop, moderate bitterness, minerally chalky dry finish.
Sort of a bit like a pilsner brewed with an ale yeast - nothing exciting.",Muggus69

Brassneck Employee of the Month - Galaxy,3.4,"Vancouver, British Columbia",Brassneck Brewery,"Amber, just a bit of chill haze on this one. Classic APA appearance, though on this pour the head isn't great. The aroma hints at a potential clash between the chewier low-lov crystal malts and the bright lychee of the galaxy. Galaxy doesn't play well with caramelization. On the palate, it's not a clash, but rather a diminution, the caramel notes talking loudly over the galaxy's beautiful song. It's not even a lot of caramel - any C hop can handle way more. But galaxy isn't built for this, which is probably why Brassneck hasn't done galaxy for this series before; it's not your first choice for this recipe. In truth, you make single hop series beers to learn lessons like this; and the process is just as much fun for the engaged drinker as it is for the brewer.",Oakes

Outer Range Kicker Pilsner,3.5,"Frisco, Colorado",Outer Range Brewing,"Can.

Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Arrrghh, such a shame about the excess residual sugar and low bitterness...this could have been a 4+ beer with those wonderful aroma hops and overall cleanliness. Less alcohol would have helped too (pretty much bock strength). So close!",Ernest
Brassneck / Boombox Ultra-Magnetic,3.2,"Vancouver, British Columbia",Brassneck Brewery,"Can from brewery. Murkadelic appearance, thin foam, not sure if this trub should be consumed right away or what. The nose is bright hops, but muted by a mountain of yeasty sludgey stuff. On the palate, it's better. First, it has an orange rind bitter punch to it. There's also a somewhat juicy character, like maybe a touch of acidity there, and I even get a little touch of sweet malt. It's still more towards the muddled side, but the brighter elements on the palate make me happy. This is one of those beers on which my opinion vacillates from one sip to the next.",Oakes
"Magnify Trade Proof (Raspberry, Strawberry, Blackberry, Guava, & Boysenberry)",4.2,"Fairfield, New Jersey",Magnify Brewing Company,"16 oz can from the brewery, 4/19/20.  Reddish-people in color.  Small head, the lace goes from minimal to heavy as you get deeper into the can.  Looks much more like a smoothie than a beer.  When you smell it you get nothing but freshly juiced berries.  Some hints of malt and dough, and maybe a smidgen of yeast, but the fruit is the star, the co-star, and most of the supporting players too.  A pretty damn delicious berry smoothie that you can hardly call beer.  I feel like I should drink this in the morning before work to start my day, I don't drive or even go anywhere anyway these days...  
One of the more unique and interesting beers I've ever had.  Wow!  No clue how to properly rate this, but I settled here.

Staggeringly Good Prize Fighter of Hell Creek,3.5,"Portsmouth, Hampshire",Staggeringly Good Brewery,"Strong saison with chokeberries and fermented with champagne yeast, basically a fruited version of Prize Fighter of Antiquity, from a beautiful can depicting the brewery's 'mascot' dinosaur.  Initially inches thick, very foamy, pillowy, slowly thinning and eventually opening, lilac coloured head on a misty deep ruby red beer with purplish glow - a pretty sight for sure.  Aroma initially dominated by sharp carbon dioxide (like when opening a bottle of artificially carbonated water), but this quickly retreats to make room for impressions of rosé champagne, red chokeberries indeed but in a rather straightforward way (concentrate?), some berry skin but also elderberry syrup, blueberry crumble and strawberry ice cream, red apples, hints of vanilla, dried dandelion leaves, roses, cream, radish peel.  Onset packed with chokeberries with elderberry- and strawberry-like aspects, fleshy and creamy, more like jam or coulis than 'real' chokeberries and therefore far less tart and astringent than expected as well; lively carb, smooth mouthfeel, thinner than one would expect at this ABV.  Relatively restrained in both fruit sweetness and fruit acidity but still maintaining its juiciness till the end, over a light bready malt backbone and into a finish that adds more breadiness from the champagne yeast, along with a 'dark green leaf'-ish bitter aspect accentuated by a hoppy note and subtle berry skin wryness.  A faint glow of warming alcohol can be felt at the back, but gently so; ends bready, fruity in a not very 'expressive' way and bitterish.  Chokeberries are commonly used in Eastern Europe but far less familiar in Western Europe, so this choice of fruit is at least an original one for an English craft brewery, but the end result tastes very different from what I was expecting; needs more outspoken fruitiness and 'wildness', also in view of the saison intentions.  Very slick, smooth 'designer beer' for hipsters and admittedly both the chokeberries and the champagne yeast add their respective flavours in a non-ambiguous way, but the beer that sits underneath, seems to lack a bit in structure, body and depth.  Bit weird, in all, but certainly not unpleasant.",Alengrin

Nez suave malté, café torréfié, réglisse et caramel, avec une forte prégnance de fruits à coque comme les noix et les noisettes
En bouche, la première attaque est étonnante et possède un côté effervescent peu typique de ce genre de bière avec des accents de vin de noix, de réglisse moins présente, de kirsch, de pruneau avec une fin sèche étonnante sur une amertume longue.
C'est une belle réussite, tout est extrêmement bien réalisé, saveurs complexes, rondeur, l'alcool est peu présent et se fait petit face à la richesse des saveurs proposées, évidemment pour une porter, on a le goût caractéristique de café torréfié mais étonnamment ça n'est pas ce qu'on sent le plus : pruneaux, noix, notes boisées, chocolat.

Surly Barrel Aged Darkness (2016 - ),4.1,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",Surly Brewing Company,"2019 from a 750ml bottle.

Aroma is relatively strong: whiskey, coffee, dark fruits, hints of chocolate. Very nice.

Deep dark and black topped by hardly any head at all; just a bubbly cap that rapidly becomes an island of thin bubbles in the center of a black sea. Very little lacing - three or four small islets where you tipped the glass up. A very good look for this style.

Thick mouth feel, no carbonation, lots of alcohol heat. 

At the forefront of the flavor are the dark fruits, followed quickly by whiskey and alcohol. The dark malt flavors of coffee and chocolate start emerging in the middle and carry on into the finish. The aftertaste picks up a bit of bitterness. Throughout, however, the overbearing aspect of the flavor is the strong heat from the alcohol. It dominates everything else.

Overall, this would be a superb BA stout. Would be, except that it is far too hot and is extremely boozy. The strong alcohol heat significantly takes away from the underlying excellence.",MNAle

Cigar City Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Brown Ale,3.8,"Tampa, Florida",Cigar City Brewing (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective),"Brown ale with lactose (a rare adjunct in this style) flavoured with raisins, cinnamon and vanilla, from Florida's leading craft brewery, now under the CANarchy collective (along with Oskar Blues, Perrin and a few others).  Medium thick, greyish beige, membrane-lacing, small-bubbled head, well retaining around the edge and dissipating into a greyish veil in the middle, over a lightly hazy, deep mahogany brown beer with ruby red glow.  Very pungently 'desserty' aroma: pan-fried sweet apples covered in brown sugar and cinnamon powder the way my grandmother used to prepare them, raisin cake, red fruit crumble, vanilla as applied in a freshly baked muffins, hints of freshly ground nutmeg, cloves, brownies, ground pecan nuts, hard caramel, faint whiffs of iron, dry tree leaves, tea and acorn shells.  Sweet onset but not in a cloying way and surrounded by a sourish edge, rather spritzy with fruity notes of cranberry, blackberry, pear and red apple, lively carbonated; smooth, slick mouthfeel, a tad metallic on its edges and a bit on the thin side for a brown ale, even at this ABV (strangely the announced lactose does little to add sweetness and even less to add creaminess - I guess it has been used sparsely).  Very pecan nut-, cocoa powder-, Pumpernickel bread- and caramel-like middle though in a very smooth, somewhat resinous way; sweetish maltiness with a bittering toasty tail (though gently so), aromatized to a high degree by the cinnamon, again - combined with the fried red apple aspect - reminding me of my grandmother's kitchen...  Raisins add a sourish hint in the end, while the vanilla remains noticeable, but less so than expected based on its more obvious presence orthonasally.  Wet-toast-like bitterish finish sprinkled with cinnamon, but also with nutmeg- and clove-like hints; hops add a herbal, tea-ish late bitterness, but the raisin cake- and crumble-like effects remain firmly in place, aromatically suggesting sweetness while the actual flavour does end bitter, even a bit coffeeish.  Hybridization is one of the key aspects in modern craft brewing, to the extent that traditional beer styles often get blurred; this one is very clearly influenced by the pastry stout hype, but acts out this influence in a proportionally subtle way, so that the whole beer does remain firmly rooted in the American brown ale tradition.  I love a good Anglo-Saxon brown ale (American or English) every now and then but this old beer family got snowed under a bit by other styles in the past one or two decades, so I can accept this 'dessert' interpretation as a way to draw more attention to it from younger beer geeks.  Expected a bit more creaminess, but it sure answers to all expectations, both on the general American brown ale level and the 'pastry' aspect, even if the vanilla could have (again) been a bit more outspoken for me.",Alengrin

Schneider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock,4.0,"Kelheim, Bavaria",Schneider Weisse G. Schneider & Sohn GmbH,"06-04-2020; bottle; at home (bought Bier&Zo, Rotterdam, The Netherlands).
The looks of the beer are nice. It is a nice copper coloured beer, with a reddish copper glow. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice layer of slightly greyish-white foam is formed. Foam retention is low. A minimal drape is left on the beer only. Not bad.
The aroma of the beer is nice. There is a rich malty palate. Toffee and caramel, together with some refined smokey and slightly toasty notes. There is dried fruit, plum and nice dark tobacco. I like a robust maltiness like this. It gives a rich sweetness. Hops are herbal and a bit earthy. A bit dark, good together with the darker but warming malt notes. It is a harmonious beer. Alcohol gives a sweet aroma. Some fruity yeast notes finish it. 
The taste is nice. It is quite sweet. Not only the malts give strong sweetness, also the alcohol is nice and sweet. Hops give bitterness and also these slightly toasty and roasty notes give some bitterness. The result is a sweet beer, yet it remains balanced. Shouldn't be even a bit sweeter though. 
The palate off the beer is allright. Medium-full body, thick full texture and medium carbonation. The alcohol is quite heavy. The finish is filled with that warming alcohol sweetness, just the max. Glad I have a small glass only. This is a beer that should be enjoyed at ease. Also some nice malty aromas are there in the finish. A nice beer it is. Heavy, intense and full.",Gangstergafje

Finishes juicy yet dry...if that is even possible...kind of a tannic / oaky dryness that allows the fruit to still shine.  Light mouthfeel with a delightful mild effervescence.

Jolly Pumpkin / Anchorage Matame Ahorita,3.4,"Dexter, Michigan",Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,"750 ml bottle

A winning collaboration between two nationally adept breweries hits the spot. While not my favorite Jolly Pumpkin sour it does provide a notable and memorable experience from start to finish. Coming from another brewery I might be more impressed. Coming from Dexter and Anchorage I did expect just a bit more than what was delivered.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
The golden transparent base soaks up the mellow white head. Herbal spices, cool hops, and a laid back mellow aspect soothe the nose with a sour but generally low key nature.

FLAVOR / PALATE
White pepper and herbal spices work over the palate as the dry nature takes full hold of the senses. The funky sour highlights take center stage within a few seconds and do not release their grip until after the strong finish. i certainly was not expecting the earthy finish that popped up after the third sip. Ultimately there wasn't enough here to really wow the way that many other entries in their lineup do.",Brigadier

Tons and tons of grapefruit are imparted by the generous usage of Citra. The malt body is pretty light but still noticeably bready. Bitterness is medium low for the style but still a little present.

Appearance is deeply hazy yellow-orange with decent sparkle, finger width white foamy head with excellent retention and nice soapy lacing. Aroma is nice grapefruit, citrus, grape, berries, transient whiff of herb. Taste is strong grape dominant but some grapefruit in there for different flavor and to offset the sweet. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with smooth texture, lively carbonation and crisp finish as taste with mild lingering bitterness. Overall, great look and the Nelson and Mosaic have a very nice yin-yang complementary relationship, filling in where the other is weak or needs restraint. Over carbonation detracts from appreciating the flavor. Age beyond ideal window didn't appear to hurt this, though you never know. Would be interesting to rerate with a fresher sample.",tfontana

Aroma of slightly honeyed pils malt with some cracker tones, sweet lemon, fresh flowers, grass and dried earth.

Founders Imperial Stout,4.1,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark-brown head. Smells of caramel, roasted, almost smoked malt, chocolate and coffee and just a hint of peat and earthy/herbal hops. Taste is a great balance between caramel, roasted, and slightly smoky, almost peaty malt, with some dark, bitter chocolate and coffee as well as lighter notes of toffee and dark fruit: plum, raisin and just a hint of licorice, tobacco and earthy/herbal hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, peat, chocolate and coffee lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

A very nice Imperial Stout that features some not too heavy, yet distinct, peat smoke notes along with the roasted, caramel malts and dark, bitter chocolate and coffee, but balanced nicely by some sweeter toffee and dark fruits, as well as bitter, earthy/herbal hop accents. Perhaps not quite what I expected from this, but still quite impressive in its own right, with a perhaps slightly unusual flavor profile and great balance of sweet, roasted, smoky and bitter notes. Quite complex, yet very well-balanced, as I would expect from Founders, with all of the different notes standing on their own without overpowering each other. Mouthfeel is nice and full, but could still be richer and creamier in my personal opinion.",snowcrash000

Finishes slightly tangy with a light bitterness and some clove and banana lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

I was quite surprised just how close this is to their regular Weissbier Hell, with the malts feeling a bit more toasted and a rather light roastiness, but apart from that the flavor profile is very much the same. Maybe that's to be expected, but I would have wished for a little more roastiness and generally fuller character, while I also think that that certain tanginess in the finish is even less becoming here than in their Weissbier Hell.",snowcrash000

A very nice Weizen that certainly has those estery notes expected of the style, although the spice is very much dominant here, with the banana staying a bit more in the background and some light hoppy accents poking through as well. I really liked this, but even though I'm usually a big fan of Andechs I didn't really love it and I'm not sure why. Maybe the balance is a little off for my personal taste, this being somewhat sweet, maybe the body is just a touch too light, making this very refreshing but a little lacking in mouthfeel, maybe it's that certain tanginess in the finish, which may not be entirely out of character for the style but is just slightly too pronounced here, or maybe it's just that I had Weihenstephaner recently and this just doesn't live up to it. In any case, still a beer that I would happily drink again anytime, it just didn't wow me as much as I thought it might.",snowcrash000

9.6%ABV Bottled 09/19/17
Deep brown sort of beer with small beige cap holding.
Oooo it smells sinister - like the fate of the world in this dark time - sort of rich dark brown sugar & pudding like sweetness upfront, spices integrate with bourbony/oak notes of vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, sour mash corn, toasted coconut and butter.
Palate is slick & thick; a distinct oily mouthfeel that you sort of rarely come across, fairly low carbonation seems to help.
Flavour is unlikely anything I've ever come across - almost reminds me of a carrot cake - slight edge of baked veggies yet sweet, caramelised, delicious, with cakey/pudding notes, brown sugar, then an array of spices layered in boozy butter, vanillary Bourbon with hints of cocoa and molasses on a finish with smokey chilli warmth

Intense coffee aroma, highly toasted notes, a lot of cocoa and dark chocolate. Some vanilla with low sweetness and the alcohol is present but less than supposed for its ABV! Very well inserted....some yeasty aromas as well.
On mouth, dense, bulky and full of toasted stuff. Cocoa, coffee and toasted notes brings the bitterness but in a very well balanced way, with a little accent of coffee, like an espresso. High bitterness but fully came from toasted notes at the end of the sip. A low sweetness get stuck on lips after every sip.
Aftertaste brings the bitterness, with more coffee and toasted notes (bread) and a nice toasted malted end.
The alcoholic heat is very interesting but no as high as it was supposed, wich turns this beer into a nice alcoholic trap and more easy to drink than others of this style.

Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier,3.0,"Bamberg, Bavaria",Brauerei Heller,"Wygląd:
Złociste, piana bialutka, średnio obfita drobne i średni pęcherze, prezentuje się ładnie.

Aromat:
Delikatnie wędzony, jest też chyba lekki DMS, trochę kwiatowych nut od chmielu. Nic specjalnego.

Smak:
Jest wyraźny DMS w smaku, chyba że to wędzonka w połączeniu ze skarpetową goryczką daje takie odczucie. Na pewno jest wędzone, na początku wydaje się słodkie w taki kukurydziany i sposób, ale po przełknięciu staje się wytrawne wędzone, z goryczką skarpetową, nieprzyjemną i lekko zalegającą.

Dieu du Ciel! Péché Mortel (Bourbon),4.7,"Montréal, Quebec",Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!,"One of a number of variations on the Pêché Mortel theme by this leading Canadian craft brewer, vintage bottle of several years old; huge thanks to tderoeck for sharing, this one was high on my list.  Mocha-beige, mousy, open head but with a waferthin beige ‘veile’ in the middle, black robe with hazy burgundy edges.  Aroma of hazelnut purée, toffee, sweet bourbon, clear coffee powder (still relatively fragrant after years of aging), old oak wood, almond, bayleaf, old dusty cinnamon, caramel, brown rum, vanilla beans, treacle, solventy note of fresh paint.  Sweet, dense onset with a light sourish edge, notes of raisins, dates and pear, softly carbonated, deep, full, viscous body.  Massive, layered malt body, toffee, chocolate, roasted peanuts and indeed – towards the end – a lot of coffee, both aromatic (as in real coffee) and roasty-bitter from the beer’s malt bill itself, both of which work perfectly together (as in the regular version).  Beautifully bittersweet ending with ornamental vanilla-like oak woodiness and indeed warming, sweet bourbon galore with a spicy effect, but the opulent, chocolatey, bittersweet maltiness prevails till the very last drop.  Clearly the mistake to drown a beautiful beer in a vat of hot booziness has not been made here: the bourbon barrel aging has been applied with great care, relative subtlety and utmost beauty.  A masterpiece, many barrel aged ‘impies’ can learn from this one.",Alengrin

AleSmith Old Numbskull - Rye Barrel Aged,4.2,"San Diego, California",AleSmith Brewing Company,"The rye whisky version in a series of barrel aged variants AleSmith made of their Old Numbskull barleywine, vintage bottle from 2013 so seven years old at the time of sampling, again thanks to tderoeck.  Off-white, bubbly, loose, open head which rapidly dissolving completely over a beautifully ‘autumny’ deep copper-brown beer, seemingly just a tad darker than the brandy version when held next to it.  Lovely bouquet of caramel, whisky, oxidized tawny port, lots of vanilla-scenting oak, pecan nut pie, walnut cheddar, hazelnut liqueur, honey, candied figs, marmalade.  Sweet, even bit sticky onset, candied cherry, fig jam, very light sourish undertone, soft carbonation, equally full and vinous body as the brandy barrel aged variant we tasted next to it.  Very rich toffeeish, hazelnutty and biscuity maltiness with that very light toasty-bitterish edge, all penetrated by a strong, drying booziness and equally strong, almost astringent tannic woodiness.  Quickly gains a rye whisky flavour, ‘hot’ and peppery, remaining sweeter and nuttier than the brandy version, and in that sense perhaps a bit more accessible – as well as somehow less far removed from the basic beer’s own features.  I personally found the brandy version a bit more interesting than this one because it had developed flavours that had driven it away further from the basic beer, but obviously both variants are highly profiled, luxuriously rich and complex sipping beers.

Founders Imperial Stout,5.0,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"16-03-2020; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bière, as part of their March 2020 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are delicious. It is the perfect Stout look. The beer is very dark. The beer is pitch black. In a bright light only the slightest reddish brown glow can be seen. It is hardly anything. On top there is a lovely dark brown layer of foam. Foam retention is good. A nice drape lays on top of the beer for quite some time. Nice lacing is left on the glass. Perfect.
The aroma of the beer can also be called perfect. The malts give some delicious aromas. There is amazing chocolate, coffee, roasted and toasted malts. There are caramel and toffee notes a bit more in the back. Also some nice tobacco and plum and other dried darker fruit. It is a bouquet of delicious aromas, very nice. The hops give some herbal and earthy notes, really nice with the darker malt notes. It has all the aromas you'd expect in a Stout. I can imagine this beer ages well in a cellar. 
The taste of the beer is also amazing. The malts give nice sweets, but also a slight bitterness form the roast and some savory notes from the toast. Quite well balanced. The hops are nice and bitter as well. The beer is very well balanced. Amazing.
The palate of the beer is very nice too. It has a full body and a very smooth texture; both creamy and silky. The carbonation is medium-low. The finish of the beer is very nice.

Taste follows the aroma, lovely strong Citra orange and mango notes on top of a masterfully crafted adjunct lager - the normally naff grains are here combined to make a fruity bouquet, both corn and rice doing their bit to provide light sweet malt for the hops to sit atop. Pouring the yeast in joins things up and makes them fruitier again but perhaps makes it less lager-y. Regardless, Northern Monk (and Brethren 0006) are playing with fire here and it shows, so tread carefully less it become sickly - one can should be fine, however.

Mouthfeel is medium side of light-to-medium bodied with smooth texture, average carbonation with pleasant mild alcohol warmth and sweet finish as taste.

Intricately cobweb-lacing, off-white, thick but opening, irregularly mousy head on a completely crystal clear, pale golden blonde beer with fierce strings of sparkling rising up from the bottom.  Aroma of freshly cut green apples, halfripe green kiwi, damp hay, green melon, white bread crumbs, tulips, freshly cut woodsorrel leaves, lime peel, raw 'courgette', parsley, soggy breakfast cereals.  Clean but crisp, fruity onset, hinting at green apple, hard pear and a dash of unripe banana, fizzy and minerally carbonation adding further crispness, slick mouthfeel; sweetish white-bready maltiness, aromatized by the Galaxy with retronasal aspects of crushed green gooseberries, lime and green melon but also bittered by a spicy, eventually slightly rooty bitterness.  The rounded, simple but rather full-bodied malt sweetishness comes through in the end, but the Galaxy sure gets its moment to shine.  Bright, crisp and easily drinkable golden ale, very British indeed but with the Australian twist performing well, both in terms of aroma and bitterness.  Quenching and likeable enough.",Alengrin

Quite intense aroma of crushed black peppercorns, roasted walnuts, unsugared chocolate, grapefruit peel, coffee grounds, thyme, 'blood'-like natural iron, burnt caramel, dark green tree leaves, black tea, cigar ashes, beef stock.  Sweetish onset with sourish undertone, very light black olive-like umami accent, medium fizz; supple, lean, oily body, very roasted-nutty core with blood-like metallic edges, black coffee and toast, rounded, with a firm, spicy, leafy and slightly citrus peel-like hop bitterness dominating the tail, a tad quinine-like in the end, bringing some retronasal aspects of dried thyme, old dry grapefruit peel and black pepper, filling the finish in  a dry, long-bitter way, though the nuttiness of the malts keeps things rounded and balanced.  Focused, streamlined and technically well-executed dry stout indeed; I must admit that I did, perhaps, expect a bit more expressive and aromatic hoppiness with luscious black IPA-like ambitions, but this beer remains firmly in the dry stout range in spite of the Mosaic (and not thanks to it).

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen,3.5,"Bamberg, Bavaria",Brauerei Heller,"1 pint 0.9 oz. bottle

AROMA:  Heavy scent of smoke with undertones of sugary sweetness like brown sugar.

APPEARANCE:  Pours an opaque dark brown with a tall, frothy, off-white head that dissipates very slowly.

TASTE:  There's a light bitterness with just a touch of sour and some sweetness on the backend, along with a lot of smoke flavor throughout.

MOUTHFEEL:  Medium-bodied with a slightly sticky texture.  Carbonation is average and the finish is long and smoky.

OVERALL:  If you're a smoke lover then this beer is for you!  There is a ton of smoke aroma and flavor throughout.  But then what would you expect from something classified as a smokebeer?

This is a nice beer but I have to admit that by the time I finished the bottle I was a little sick of the smokiness.  So I'm thinking a 12 oz. bottle might be a better fit for this brew, than the 17 oz. bottle.",ironprog

Jester King Viking Metal,5.0,"Austin, Texas",Jester King Brewery,"Attained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $18.99, Viking Metal is a smoked farmhouse ale brewed with juniper and myrica gale and aged in gin barrels crafted by Jester King Brewery from Austin, Texas.

The air yields smoked oak, juniper, gin, myrica gale, and wild yeast funk upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow with a low white head. When held up to light, the cloudy aspect is clearer. The alcohol content is 8.3%.

Oak smoked wheat is rich, imbued upon the mouthfeel, and tasted when you lick your chops. Smoked malt barley compliments the oak smoked wheat and deepens the smoked aspect. Flaked rye softly spices the take and glows with the barley hue. Gin eases the drink and flavors the smokey body. Juniper berries lightly accents the take with the flaked rye and sweetens the beer. Lemon gently tarts the comprehension and tones the drink. Brettanomyces yeast brings a moderate, hay, musty funk notable with the rye and has a light lactic tinge in the slightly dry finish. Myrica gale is sensible with the lemon and yeasty combination.

Viking Metal is a sensational smoked farmhouse ale. The oak smoked wheat, smoked malt barley, flaked rye, gin, juniper berries, funky Brettanomyces yeast, and myrica gale sets this craft beer apart from the rest of the market. The oak smoked wheat, smoked malt barley, and flaked rye blend beautifully and are expressive upon the mouthfeel. The rye and juniper berries are enticing and easy to experience. The lactic and tart lemon is watered down and barely noticeable to the other characters of the beer. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. The gin and water quality takes this to another level.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Overall
Very sweet but not cloying. Rich and powerful. Nice stuff. But drinkers in China must be aware that this beer comes with white wax in other contries, while in China market the same beer comes with four kinds of wax at a much higher price.
甜而不腻，浓郁而强劲。好东西。但需要中国消费者注意的是，这酒在国外是统一的白色蜡封，但在中国市场上同样的酒有四种不同颜色的蜡封款，而且价格要高的多。

Mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with thin, frothy texture, average-to-lively texture, and crisp, dry finish with lingering bitterness. Overall, strong, complex aroma is the strength here with slightly less interesting taste. I'd agree with many previous reviewers that this doesn't fit the style, except this was invented before the style was!

Smuttynose Smuttlabs Three Ways to Sundae,1.2,"Hampton, New Hampshire",Smuttynose Brewing Company,"Poured from 32 oz. crowler. 

Clear gold color with small ivory head that disappeared quickly and sparse lacing. A truly ugly beer. 

Aroma of strawberry, very sweet tangerine (like the way tangerine gum drops would smell, if there was such a thing), vanilla and the barest hint of cocoa powder, if you let the beer warm a little. 

Taste follows the nose very closely. Except however, it developed an alum aftertaste after I let it sit for half an hour. That was nasty.  I poured it down the drain. 

Medium/light body and low/medium carbonation. 

This beer does not look appealing and everything else about it pretty much followed suit. The strawberry is patently obvious, the vanilla about right and the chocolate almost imperceptible. The the excessive sweetness ruined anything the beer had going for it, which wasn’t much.

GLASSWARE: 22oz. pilsner... pours a tawny, sallow, champagne-tinged body with active effervescence... its head does the usual malt-free disappearing act, though its bubbles continue to rise and disperse at the weight of air... really not appealing in this light... immediate sorghum, hard fruits like apple, banana and pear, candied sugars, cosmetic counter perfume overload and a base solvency... nothing really alluring here, unless you dig cider or sorghum... its first sip is dry, thin, nearly lifeless (watery) and without fanfare... a late bubble in the throat may suggest its intentions, but it doesn't muster much beyond a thin rinse... I turn to Billy, and his reaction suggest Coors Light has not been approximated... the flavor is constantly ebbing, with faint hints of berry, apple, sorghum, cheerio, and bubblegum fluttering in and out of the picture, elusively if not frustratingly so... its singular profile doesn't leave much else to say, so I end with a simple disclaimer: if you have already enjoyed malted beer in any form, there's no need to dance with this one.... if you are a Celiac sufferer, maybe these will grow on you... all the same, cider might be a better option...",Dacrza

Dead Armadillo Amber,0.3,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",Dead Armadillo Craft Brewing,"I didn't want to write this review. I searched their website to try and find a way to contact them. No luck. I don't have a problem per se with the brewery. In fact I love a number of their brews on tap and some in cans. The reason for this post is they have outsourced one of their flagship brews, the Amber.

I have been a fan of this brew, at the brewery, and in cans until about a year ago. It started tasting different. So I haven't bought much in the past few months. In the last couple of weeks I purchased 2 six packs. Both were poor flavor, but what is worse there is sediment in the bottom of the glass.

This is not one or two flakes of something. This is enough dark stuff to fill a teaspoon. I don't know what it is - but what I am saying is - they have a problem with those that brewing and canning for them. And they do not have a way to contact them.

Aroma of grass, pungent biscuity malt, alcohol, dry hay, but sadly - a bunch of skunky and metallic cents that are stronger than anything else! Light-bodied; Deep yeastie and grassy profile at first that shows bread, light alcohol, a bunch of light biscuits and malt with some very mellow citrus and herbal notes that finishes almost menthol-y - odd! Aftertaste shows the grass and very light, floral and malt notes with a bunch of dry characteristics and the faintest bit of citrus and sweetness imaginable - but does show something slightly different than just the skunky bread and yeastie notes with the pale biscuity malt character.

The nose offers an unpleasant aroma of rotting oranges, moldy orange peel, toasted caramel, rancid butter, and plastic/chemical.  Amazingly, it gets worse.  Flavors of plastic, bitter orange peel, and rotting vegetables are pretty terrible.  I can't get past the sense of rotting, moldy, fermenting oranges.  There's a bit of buttery character, but it's a minor quibble in comparison.  Super harsh bitterness just dominates the finish with strong, lingering astringency.

Aroma is lightly malty (grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot, melon), with notes of onion, ammonia, body odor, plastic bags, stomach acid.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, unclean.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Sprint Light,1.3,"Monroe, Wisconsin",Minhas Craft Brewery (Minhas Brewery),"Crystal clear coloured body with a light soapy, white head that starts at about a centimetre and fades quickly, like soda and leaves no lace at all. The glow is lightly golden, but this is more watery clear than even golden - pretty mild throughout the look. Aroma of stale malt, light grain, a dash of hay, some grass and a relatively stale and subdued caster sugar note that has some sweetness to add to the watery and foul malt smells. Ultra-light-bodied; Super mild malt flavours show at first with some grass, hay and almost like a musty sugar flavour that hits a mild sweetness, again, on top of just about nothing, but water, very light grain and hay. Aftertaste is super mild and subdued grain and grass with the light caster sugar and funky flavours with a touch of bread and yeast on the very end - not much going on here at all, of course. Overall, a very poor and incredibly bland beer - there really wasn't anything offensive here, aside from the stale malt, but the taste was just watery, bland and very simplistic. I sampled this sixteen ounce, pint-sized can, purchased from Lidl [grocery] in Manassas, Virginia on 16-October-2017 from one of my co-workers, sampled on 26-February-2020, purchased for US$3,99/six pack - Thanks Tom!",jgb9348

Got from a German supermarket, a four pack, coming in a very cool looking logo of a brewer and his beer, happy with his accomplishment! An unfiltered traditional cloudy beer. 

Have to say it looks absolutely fantastic on pour, a very lovely frothy white head appearing with a beer that has a gorgeous golden colour with a deep look.

A very decent head that sticks around, some good lacing, and with the deep hazy orange look, we have a great looking beer to admire.

On the nose one gets a very, very malty aroma, very clear and easy to find. An ok malty and yeasty smell, not bad at all.

On to the taste, very soft and creamy on the tongue initially, crispy and inoffensive, not much flavouring to taste and very, very smooth. Light and not really hitting the spot.

A lot of malts and some light grains, as expected, and a bit of fruit, but very light and very boring. Kind of a waste of time, with nothing really to get stuck into in terms of prominent or excitable tastes or flavours, dont think I will be buying this one again.

Aroma of ultra funky yeasts with some ashtry, a dash of brine, a lot of caster sugar, icing sugar, fake fruits and a big hit of old ladies (think grandmother) perfume - very funky, fragrant and pungent in a bad way. Light-bodied; Sharp fake lime flavous dominate at first with a lot of lactose and creamy notes with a lot of perfume, hay, grass and funky yeast flavours that show through as the old lady perfume of yesteryear, but in the mouth, which makes it that much worse. Aftertaste shows some somewhat better and lighter lime and lemon citrus notes, but the yeast and briney, salt components show stronger and leaves the palate somewhat salty and ready for the next sip, despite the perfume and funky yeast qualities. Overall, a pretty funky, pungent and odd-tasting beer that never seems to align with the style and/or what they were trying to produce, given the fact that the caster sugar, perfume and funky yeasts all hit about the same level and the citrus, brine and malt don't really show at all. Not really worth trying to find, unless you love your grandmother, her old perfume or a really funky yeast and citrus combination of a 'beer'.

Aroma of yes, unflattering malt and water with some light corn sugar thrown in the mix, but this is pretty bad, especially in the nose. Ultra-light-bodied throughout; Strong grainy and malt-based flavours that show more corn and ricer and fillers than any actual malts with a very light sweetness from honey and corn syrup at the end, but only a dash of vegetal flavours come through that vary anything from the not-so-good malts and off-sugars. Aftertaste shows the pure corn syrup and funky malts throughout without much else aside from water. Overall, a pretty standard 'macro light' beer that you'd expect with funky malt compontents, a lot of bad and off-flavours that aren't so good. I sampled this tweleve ounce can, given to me by my coworker, purchased from Lidl in Manassas, Virginia on 16-October-2017 for US$3,99/six pack, sampled at home in Washington on 08-January-2020.",jgb9348
Castle Eden Christmas Chestnut Ale,1.9,"Seaham, Durham",Castle Eden Brewery,"330ml glass, and boxed, bottle dated as best before 30/07/2020. Given to me as a Christmas gift. Served fridge cold into a pint glass. 

The beer pours a dark amber caramel colour. Generating a small white, bubbly head. Carbonation in the glass starts aggressively, but rapidly peters out.. The head reclines to nothing within a minute. 

The aroma is malt, chestnut purée and generic nuts. Cheap chocolate, reminding me of bad quality stouts and porters. Sweet with a light underlying bitter. Usually, even a poor beer smells inviting. This one just doesn’t. 

The taste is simply nut. Some can be identified as chestnut, some almond but mostly just a generic but taste. Some malt. Just like the aroma, cheap chocolate. Sweet like the aroma. The lightest lightest hint of bitter hop. 

The aftertaste is again nutty, with a flat mouthfeel. 

Not a beer for me. Too monotone and feels as if it has been badly made, or made just poor ingredients.",PubTun33

Clausthaler Original (Premium),1.7,"Frankfurt, Hesse",Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe),"Review: 0,5l, green bottle of Clausthaler Alkoholfrei original: < 0.5% vol.

Comes in a bottle that looks like a regular beer. Certainly fooled me, that’s why I bought the fucking thing, thinking it was normal beer. Damn!!!!

On the pour I have to say the beer looks fantastic, a great big frothy white head, with a lot of good lively carbonation resulting in a nice clear golden coloured beer on appearance.

Head maintains very well, and some good lacing left on the glass. A good looking beer, sparkling, surprisingly good for a non alcoholic brew.…………

Smells pretty good too, getting a nice malty aroma on the nose for sure, but also a rather strange aroma. Guess could put that down to the sweet grains and floral hops. Some stringent corn smells too. Overall not bad on the nose.

Get a lot in the bottle, which is always a big plus.

The taste is a bit urgh, all very sickly sweet and very bitter. First impressions not good at all. Kind of a spicy and creamy off taste to it. 

For a non alcoholic beer it is quite hoppy and bitter, which is very surprising to me. It certainly does taste like a beer, with the malts, barley and grains to the fore, which is impressive. Could definitely fool people into thinking it was a regular beer. 

But not pleasant really, or very enjoyable, a dry finish with an artificial bitter taste that isn’t going to do it for me, will pass, thank you very much………….",Drinking_77

The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.

There's plenty of orange juice flavor, maybe some mango, but the harsh orange peel character is all I can think about.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and obviously, pretty astringent.  Overall, another terrible beer from Abomination.  It's not so much that this is over-hopped, although an argument could be made that it is, but rather it's just very poorly executed, so all the harsh astringency remains in the finished beer.

Silly Double Enghien Brune,1.4,"Silly, Belgium",Brasserie de Silly,"Brune de 8 % abv, qui fait partie des "" double Enghien "" .. ainsi nommées.
La question pour celle-ci est de savoir précisément si c'est une double ..
Mon exemplaire était à 16 mois avant sa date.
Couleur roux sombre à l'opacité moyenne, et clarté nette.
Bulles fines, en fontaine centrale, à montée lente.
Mousse beige, à fins flocons, stable à 1 mm.
Arômes de compote de prune, cassonade, pointe de cannelle.
1ère bouche fluide, à l'entame très modérée, caramélisée.
Arrière-bouche à la définition très vague, courte.
2ème bouche avec un côté guimauve et pantouflard.
Arrière-bouche faible, indéterminée, beaucoup trop caramélisée.
Longueur qui n'améliore rien dans la définition.
Jambes huileuses, longues.
Levure basique.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau abv, il laisse faire les choses trannnnquille ...
Finale paresseuse.
CONCLUSION : cette brune n'était donc pas une double, c'est assez vexant !
Elle penche plutôt du côté des brown américaines, avec des saveurs qui 
dégoulinent quelque peu .. et lambinent en tous les cas  (3/2/2/2/5)",corkyrory66

On ne parle donc pas ici de fruits des bois ayant macéré dans le brassin mais bien d'un ajout de concentré, ce qui n'est tout de même pas la panacée. La base est de plus complètement ratée. Avec un ajout de fruits sucrés, une petite acidité est nécessaire afin de couper le sucre et donner du peps à l'ensemble. Ici la base est sucrée, ce qui rend le tout sur-sucré, et en lus sans finesse, sans complexité, et sans intérêt si ce n'est de conférer des arômes de caramel, et de cola quelque peu chimique. Je ne vois pas quelle est la cible de cette bière. Le visuel se porte sur un brun un peu rosâtre surmonté d'une mousse brune d'un cm. Même si le nez n'est pas exceptionnel, finalement celui-ci n'est pas si mal vu la dégustation avec un cocktail de fruits des bois, de caramel et une fraîche amertume. Malheureusement l'amertume ne permet pas d'équilibrer la sucrosité à la dégustation ce qui la rend lourde et écœurante, surtout que les arômes quelque peu chimiques ne sont pas agréables.

I generally like Pittsburgh brewing beers but to call this IC Light is an insult to the rock of IC Light. How fricken rude to bastardize a respected name. This is simply a light pale beer  with artificial flavors added, it is so fake it is near cloying. SO uncool. Its the balls on the barnacles at the bottom of the bombardier's barrel. First off, it looks like IC light, no color to make you think its cherry flavored.  It also smells like a cheap red Popsicle. Its fizzy and tastes something like cheap red soda, but nothing like the quality flavors of Cherokee red. Typical wan-nah be accepted new fru- fru -fruity beer. Whew. Probably should be kept out of the ratings like other stupid straight up ass soda pop flavored malt beverages. The artificial sweetener in this yields a lingering unpleasant perfume like finish  on each swig right to the end. Disappointing, not really beer; JMHO.

Not much better in the mouth...watery and overly sweet with mostly sourness for balance, and a dreadful aftertaste of mouthwash that won't go away.

Commonwealth / Late Start Botanicalia,0.9,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",Commonwealth Brewing Company,"I bought a 4 pack of this beer and I honestly don't think I can finish it. There's something really off putting about the extremely tart, sour, overly flavored taste of this beer. I feel like I'm drinking cold dish water that someone threw a bunch of fruit rinds and other herbs and spices into with every sip. I choked my way through the first can and honestly had to just toss the last few bits of the 2nd and 3rd can bc it's just too much of a chore to drink. I'm looking at the 4th can and thinking, ""well maybe one day all the stores around me will be closed and I won't be able to buy any beer."" Any port in a storm kind of beer.

Drinking this beer is just like standing in a Yorkshire pub and getting a local old brown from the tap.  It pours as a surprisingly light brown with plenty of cotton-wool head.

Aftertaste is kinda gross, again lotion-glove-resin-crust flavor clash can't be saved by lemon and a touch of pineapple.  First misfire I've had from these guys, and it's in design, not execution.

Arrogant Punishment,4.3,+1.5,Arrogant Consortia,"Attained at Westons Market Liquor from Murrieta, California for $21.85, Punishment is Stone’s Double Bastard Ale with peppers added and aged in bourbon barrels crafted by Stone Brewing Company from Escondido, California.

The aroma of chili peppers, grapefruit, toffee, caramel, bourbon, and dark fruit are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark reddish brown that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, sediment shows and the color shifts to a reddish copper. The alcohol content is 12%.

A strong spice affronts the drink and heats the body. Kentucky bourbon is sensible upon the caramel frame piercing the spicy veil. Toffee compliments the bourbon and slightly sweetens the complexion. Caramel malt textures the mouthfeel. Molasses adds a sugar touch to the drink and tasted when you lick your chops. Raisins are picked out during the spicy, caramel finish. Grapefruit is discernible as the spice wanes allowing you to notice it blending with the chilies used. 

Pine is noted as the grapefruit presence grows. Jalapeño chilies are drawn out with the grapefruit and pine characters. Serrano chilies pack a wallop of heat and spice, and brings an earthy hue to the caramel malt feel. Oak deepens the serrano and malt comprehension. Fresno chilies bring a smokiness to the malt and oak frame. Aleppo chilies give off cumin and cayenne notes to the smokey, caramel, and oak outline. Plums are distinguished with the aleppo pepper and caramel combination. 

Punishment is a punishing ale to drink in its namesake. After being aged for five years, the spice is powerful even for my standards and had to sip it slowly over time. At room temperature, the spice is easier to experience allowing you to capture the Kentucky bourbon, caramel malt, toffee, plums, and raisin body. The caramel malt, earthy serrano chili, smokey Fresno chili, and molasses merge beautifully together. Personally, I enjoyed drinking such a strong spicy and complex craft beer; on the other hand, the strength of spice means not everyone is going to like this brew. You will want to be informed before buying a bottle of Punishment. The best serving temperature to drink this beer is at room temperature.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.",dflb

Smuttynose Smuttlabs Three Ways to Sundae,1.2,-1.9,Smuttynose Brewing Company,"Poured from 32 oz. crowler. 

Clear gold color with small ivory head that disappeared quickly and sparse lacing. A truly ugly beer. 

Aroma of strawberry, very sweet tangerine (like the way tangerine gum drops would smell, if there was such a thing), vanilla and the barest hint of cocoa powder, if you let the beer warm a little. 

Taste follows the nose very closely. Except however, it developed an alum aftertaste after I let it sit for half an hour. That was nasty.  I poured it down the drain. 

Medium/light body and low/medium carbonation. 

This beer does not look appealing and everything else about it pretty much followed suit. The strawberry is patently obvious, the vanilla about right and the chocolate almost imperceptible. The the excessive sweetness ruined anything the beer had going for it, which wasn’t much.

Dead Armadillo Amber,0.3,-2.7,Dead Armadillo Craft Brewing,"I didn't want to write this review. I searched their website to try and find a way to contact them. No luck. I don't have a problem per se with the brewery. In fact I love a number of their brews on tap and some in cans. The reason for this post is they have outsourced one of their flagship brews, the Amber.

I have been a fan of this brew, at the brewery, and in cans until about a year ago. It started tasting different. So I haven't bought much in the past few months. In the last couple of weeks I purchased 2 six packs. Both were poor flavor, but what is worse there is sediment in the bottom of the glass.

This is not one or two flakes of something. This is enough dark stuff to fill a teaspoon. I don't know what it is - but what I am saying is - they have a problem with those that brewing and canning for them. And they do not have a way to contact them.

Refuge Blood Orange Wit,5.0,+1.9,Refuge Brewery,"Acquired at Liquor Depot from Temecula, California for $2.99, Blood Orange Wit is a Belgian-style fruit beer with oranges and coriander brewed by Refuge Brewery from Temecula, California.

The scent of Belgian yeast, lemon, and blood oranges are noted as you drink. The appearance is a slightly hazy yellow that pours a finger of white head. Light brightens the yellow and reveals carbonation. The alcohol content is 5%.

Oranges are juicy and citrusy to the complexion. Blood oranges fairly enrich the orange zest. Lemon lightly tarts the drink and underlines the orange and blood orange body. Belgian yeast smoothens and creams the take along with a banana touch. Coriander compliments the yeast tone. Clove softly spices the take and sensible upon the wheat and Belgian yeast frame.

Blood Orange Wit is a gorgeous Belgian style wit. The orange, blood orange, lemon, Belgian yeast, coriander, and clove blend into a delicious craft beer. The blood orange, lemon, and Belgian yeast combination is scintillating to experience. The clove becomes more prominent over time to go with the lemon and carbonation. The Belgian yeast and coriander harmonize beautifully together. I enjoyed drinking this brew and can see how it won gold at the 2017 The Great American Beer Festival.

The nose offers an unpleasant aroma of rotting oranges, moldy orange peel, toasted caramel, rancid butter, and plastic/chemical.  Amazingly, it gets worse.  Flavors of plastic, bitter orange peel, and rotting vegetables are pretty terrible.  I can't get past the sense of rotting, moldy, fermenting oranges.  There's a bit of buttery character, but it's a minor quibble in comparison.  Super harsh bitterness just dominates the finish with strong, lingering astringency.

Aftertaste is almost as bland as the profile, with some hay and grass noticeable, but that is really it, as the whole flavour at the end is incredibly watery, basic and not pleasant with stale malt being the strongest flavour that is picked up. Overall, a pretty poor beer overall, from the pour to the flavour and of course the finish, as this one is either underwhelming, watery, or just plain bad in every aspect. Obviously a passable beer in every category. I'm not sure how this is rated so highly for the style, it is pretty bad in every which-way.

Limited  roasted malt flavor mixed with an oily molasses taste and a sourish finish. Thin mouthfeel for the style. I like oatmeal stouts but this one is a miss. Infected can perhaps? At least the 6.9% ABV is well hidden.",Kleg
Pressure Drop Give Me the Message,1.8,-1.4,Pressure Drop Brewing,"440ml can at We Brought Beer, Tooting.  Oh dear, oh dear... I really thought last year’s You Are Free was a one off, a terrible fluke and a completely failed experiment that was ill-advised from the concept.  However, this beer has many of the same unpleasant characteristics.  Looks great; black with a tan head.  The aroma has those same notes of cardboard, soy sauce and vegetables.  The body is reasonable, but it bleeds into the flavour.  There’s some chocolate hidden beneath whatever weirdness has happened from the liberal abundance of mosaic hops.  It’s just not worked and the reaction is pretty unpleasant.  I should clarify that this beer is not quite the walking disaster You Are Free was, but it isn’t that far off.",Beese

Fagnes Quatres Ceréales,1.2,-2,Brasserie des Fagnes,"Bière ambrée de 7,5 % abv, en format 75 cl avec bouchon de liège.
Mon exemplaire était juste à 4 ans après sa date.
Couleur ambré orangé, aux reflets rouquins, et à la clarté pure.
Bulles moyennes, en fontaine centrale, très nombreuses et bien vives.
Mousse blanc cassé, soyeuse, stable à 2 mm.
Arômes de pommes cuites, caramel, cookie. Nez très pauvre.
1ère bouche fluide, sur un ensemble peu malté et au goût cerisé !!
Arrière-bouche avec une touche de guimauve.
2ème bouche fruitée, sucrée, très mal assemblée.
Arrière-bouche courte, sans personnalité.
Longueur sur un ensemble très quelconque de bière aux fruits rouges !!
Jambes à gros flocons, courtes.
Levure correcte.
Alcool faible, sous son niveau, il est parti moissonner d'autres céréales.
Finale banale.
CONCLUSION : cette bière est un paradoxe pur, puisqu'en utilisant
4 céréales au brassage, on trouve une bière fruitée et sucrée !!
L'âge ne l'a aucunement aidée, et la texture est très faible …

Milwaukee Special Reserve Ice,3.5,+1.7,City Brewery (La Crosse Plant),"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 9/10/2018. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Some fruity corn aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, and white bread dough; with light notes of biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, biscuit, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, not overly fruity/yeasty. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Thin but not too watery finish. Zero warming alcohol for 5.9%. Overall this is a pretty good iced pale adjunct lager style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nice clean pale malt/grain showcase, with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. Not too overdone on adjuncts.

Saint James Red Headed Stranger,5.0,+1.6,Brasserie Saint James,"As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.

The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.

Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Spéciale Sur Lie,5.0,+1.7,Haacht,"Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.

The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Abomination Pilgrimage Into the Dank,1.7,-1.5,Abomination Brewing Company,"19-Oct-19 (16-oz can, No date stamp: Purchased 13-Sep-19 for $5.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA)This Imperial IPA pours a fully cloudy, golden-yellow body and an inch of bubbly, rocky, white head that settles to a partial dusting and thin ring, leaving a few spots of lacing on the beer-clean glass.  The nose offers aromas of orange citrus, orange zest, mango, and passion fruit when first poured, but that quickly turns to cut grass, orange peel, alcohol, and an odd, nose-burning spiciness.  On the palate, there is a nice burst of juicy, tropical fruit up front, but immediately, fruitiness turns to orange peel, and the harsh, dank, grassy, and highly bitter flavors take over and finally completely dominate the finish.  The malt base is crackery with only light sweetness, but the vegetal hop assault never lets up.  The beer is medium in weight, medium in carbonation, and harsh, astringent, and zesty in mouthfeel.  Overall, this is not enjoyable to drink.  It's harsh, astringent, very bitter, and tastes like eating garden weeds.  What an unfortunate first impression with this beer brand.",DarkElf

Robinsons Trooper (Bottle),4.6,+1.6,Robinsons Family Brewery,"Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maiden’s vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.

Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UK’s craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Natural Light,3.7,+2.6,Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev),"This beer has always gotten an undeserved bad rap mostly because it's price lends itself to first time drinkers who abuse it and themselves. Early marketing proclaimed it as the ""beer with the taste for food"". And that is how I discovered it with a friend serving it along with hot wings.  Thirty-five years later it is still a beer you will most frequently find in my fridge. To me it is better than and certainly no worse than Bud Light, Miller Lite, or Coors Light. Beers that my neighbors and friends stock their fridges with. You won't see flashy ads on TV for Natty light, but if you think that extra couple of dollars you have to pay for those previously mentioned brands is because of better taste/quality, you would be mistaken. In fact, I did a blind taste test with a group of neighbors a couple of summers ago and Natty Light won with 2 out of 3 of them. Hardly ""scientific"", but evidence that perception/reputation is more powerful than reality.

There are a number of more expensive beers that I also enjoy very much (Sam Adams Summer Ale, Terrapin Hopsecutioner, Harp to name but a few), but you are far more likely to find Natural Light in my fridge on a given weekend and I make no apologies at all for it.

Mousse beige, à fins flocons, stable à 1 mm.
Arômes de compote de prune, cassonade, pointe de cannelle.

Propolis Prunus (11/13) ,5.0,+1.6,Propolis Brewing,"Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $13.99, Prunus 2018 is a Flemish-style dark ale aged in a Grenache vat with black cherries crafted by Propolis Brewing from Port Townsend, Washington.

The air yields Grenache wine, cherries, chocolate, and an underlying funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a dark mahogany that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, a reddish brown unveils. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Toffee is creamy to the mouthfeel. Grenache wine fills the complexion followed by black cherry tint and tart. Anise spices the take and accompanies the tart. Chocolate compliments and deepens the Grenache and black berry body. Figs are distinguished with the chocolate tone. Plums are felt with the toffee and chocolate combination. Brettanomyces yeast lightly funks the body and dries the finish while bringing out raisins on the mouthfeel. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the chocolate, black cherry, and Grenache frame.

Prunus 2018 is a delectable Flemish-style dark ale. The Grenache wine, black cherries, chocolate, toffee, plums, figs, and raisins blend together into a remarkable craft beer. The chocolate and toffee is savory, and welcomes the Grenache and black cherry notes. The Grenache wine style, black cherry tart, and anise provides a unique experience upon the take. As the beer warms, the chocolate, figs, and plums become more prominent. I treasured drinking this beer and dazzled by its depth and complexity. This is not a one-and-done beer, so it will be brewed again.

Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"C’est une bière très bien équilibrée. Clairement, c’est un opéra dans le verre et dans le gosier. Acte 1 : le malt et les nuances de fruits mûrs. Ça lui donne beaucoup de puissance mais elle reste légère. Acte 2 : le houblon se fait très discret en fin de gorgée pour laisser le devant de la Cène (attention au jeu de mot blasphématoire) à des notes caramélisées et chocolatées. Dit comme ça, sur le papier, on aurait tendance à croire qu’elle est sucrée. Mais que nenni la biche ! Grâce à la double fermentation, elle garde un caractère puissant et naturel sans que l’alcool ne prenne tout le goût. Pour être franc on le sent quasiment pas.",FrothyStave49
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"Le goût est riche et très équilibré, ce qui fait monter la côte de cette bière dans mon coeur. Cet équilibre se trouve dans l’entremêlement du malt, du houblon et de l’alcool. Cette richesse de gout s’équilibre également par la mousse, dense, qui rend de la douceur a l’ensemble. En arrière de cette équilibre, on retrouve les notes fruitées que l’on sentait au départ. Ce goût et surtout cet équilibre se prolongent tout au long de la dégustation.",FlightLegion58
Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,+1.6,Vauclair,"La bière est bonne, très bien équilibrée, le dosage est parfait. Simple à boire, elle a le gout de la bière (meilleure analyse du monde). Enfin d’une bière qui se laisse boire facilement et qui ne se veut pas forte et riche en gout. Nous avons un malt et un houblon assez jeunes qui laissent ce côté fraîcheur (chill) qui me plaît de plus en plus dans la bière.",MashForever56
Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,+1.6,Vauclair,"En bouche, cette bière est assez douce. Elle paraît simple à première vue mais finalement elle est assez complexe, comme pas mal de goûts différents participent à l’accord et à l’équilibre global. Elle est toute en contradiction : douce mais alcoolisée, acide et amer mais sucrée.

A première vue, on a un goût de malt et d’alcool puis elle s’adoucit par une fin de bouche assez sucrée. On découvre également une amertume qui s’étale sur la longueur et se marie avec alcool. On perd le goût d’alcool au fil des gorgées, tandis que l’amertume  se libère au fur et à mesure et s’associe au sucré, ce qui apporte de la douceur. Tout cela est complété par une acidité qui rappelle celle du vin.",YeastLees62
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"Dès la première gorgée, elle se savoure. Elle est très bonne d’entrée de jeu et c’est bon signe ! Le houblon est bien présent et elle est très fruitée, puis, le malt arrive en fin de bouche. Un goût complet et équilibré. En plus, elle est belle (« Vous avez vu ma femme ? Elle est belle hein ? Oui chef »), avec sa mouche bien blanche et plutôt dense pour une blonde. Au long de sa dégustation, accompagnée de la socca de René, évidemment, elle se montre légère et idéale pour accompagner la recette qui l’a inspirée !",CaskTasty56
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"Ce qui frappe d’entrée de jeu avec cette jolie blonde est son amertume. Elle est très présente, ce qui lui confère beaucoup de caractère. Mais ne vous en faites pas, cette amertume est, en partie, contre-balancée par l’arôme floral, qui se révèle être le goût principal de cette bière autour duquel gravitent d’autres goûts, qui persistent plus dans la longueur.

En fait, on découvre un goût de levure qui demeure mais la palme de la persistance en bouche revient à cette amertume. Elle est amère, les amateurs de Bud ou autre Heineken passeront leur chemin. Et les amateurs du genre seront comblés ! Je sens que je vous fais un peu peur, alors on va vous remettre en appétit : la mousse, généreuse, est excellente et donne vraiment envie de plonger le nez dedans. Et, ce petit goût floral vaut le détour.

On doit aussi noter qu’elle fait pas mal de dépôt, c’est bon signe : on boit de la vraie bière, pas pasteurisée et compagnie !",FrothyStave48
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"Vous le sentez ? Moi oui ! C’est le goût de la bière qui coule dans la gorge et la volonté qui reviennent. Revoilà cette sensation de fraîcheur, ses fines bulles qui pétillent telle une Badoit un jour de grand soif. Une résurrection. Tel le phœnix renaissant de ses cendres. La bière est parfaitement équilibrée ! Une attaque très caractérielle, on remarque la présence de plusieurs malts plus ou moins jeunes qui donnent de la légèreté et du goût à l’ensemble. On distingue la présence de blé, qui enrobe le tout. Et sur la fin, on remarque l’amertume typique des levures ajoutées à la mise en bouteille.",BeerSampler53
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"Pas besoin de vous faire un dessin, je la recommande. En ce moment je suis plutôt lassé des bières belges trop lourdes et fortes; mais en même temps, la radler c’est un peu light. Là, c’est le juste milieu.",FlightMaster61

Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"La première gorgée apporte également une légère odeur de mangue mais la sensation de douceur s’efface et est remplacée par l’alcool, que l’on sent bien en arrière-goût et qui perdure mais sans être agressif. On retrouve donc bien une bière de haute fermentation. Les gorgées suivantes apportent de nouvelles touches, de petits arômes qui se dévoilent au fur et à mesure. On trouve donc des goûts de caramel et de réglisse qui se cachent derrière la note principale de malt.",MeadExports55
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,La mousse bien épaisse donne une superbe entrée en matière et quand on arrive au breuvage là c’est le pompon ! D’abord la puissance des céréales puis on distingue des notes de caramel. Elle reste peu sucrée mais l’alcool reste discret,BarrelGuide146
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"C’est un peu complexe pour distinguer l’ensemble de ses saveurs, mais même pour des novices dans le domaine, elle se laisse apprécier. Son petit plus :  le sucre est rajouté à la mise en bouteille, ce qui permet de réactiver les levures. Là, comme ça, ça ne vous parle certainement pas mais ça veut dire que c’est une bière qui peut se conserver très longtemps et qui aura même tendance à changer de goût pour devenir encore plus puissante (et aussi avec un plus gros taux d’alcool).",KegChamp52
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,c’est une bière d’exception à boire exceptionnellement pour la savourer pleinement et toujours (re)découvrir ses nombreuses saveurs. Ses multiples facettes font qu’on en boirait bien plus que la bouteille,IBUHopper49
Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.7,+1.6,Vauclair,"A première vue, on sent ces levures. Elle se révèle assez maltée d’une part mais rafraîchissante, bien liquide de l’autre. En cette canicule ce n’est pas désagréable !
Ensuite, on découvre un petit goût de noisette ou de châtaigne. Et, au nez on remarque de discrètes effluves de whisky et de chocolat noir. Ces odeurs rappellent le Lindt Irish Coffee, eh oui, c’est important de ramener la dégustation à des choses connues d’un grand nombre. Essayez d’ailleurs d’en croquer un morceau, je suis persuadé que ce mariage sera bien meilleur qu’avec du saucisson. Ces odeurs se retrouvent également en bouche, mais toujours très discrètement. Et donc cette blonde est bien équilibrée avec des arômes que l’on décèle ça et là  ! Et cet équilibre persiste bien en bouche, donc ça, chers néophytes, c’est un très bon signe. C’est simple quand il n’y a pas de goût d’eau apparent, on est sur une bonne bière, ou du moins une bière de qualité, ça signifie que les brasseurs n’ont pas lésiné sur le malt, les levures et les houblons.

En bref, vous pourrez vous vanter de faire découvrir une bière intéressante, rafraîchissante et complexe !",MashGuide52

Vauclair Choue Blonde,4.8,+1.7,Vauclair,"Comment dire. C’est Simple. Genre vraiment simple. Mais très efficace. L’exercice est parfaitement réussi. C’est une blonde tout ce qu’il y a de plus basique. De fines bulles, un parfum de céréales et un goût de malt frais très agréable en bouche. Peu de houblons ont été utilisés pour justement retrouver le goût de la bière d’antan. Comme on l’a dit c’est simple, basique, mais très bien réalisé. Elle se boit très facilement tout en ayant du caractère. Pour vous donner une image. Comparez une Renault et une Mercedes. Les deux ont un volant, 4 roues et permettent de se déplacer. Toutefois les finitions ne sont pas les mêmes. Ici, on est au volant de l’allemande.",FlightMuse72
Vauclair Choue Blonde,5.0,+1.9,Vauclair,"En la versant dans son verre on est surpris par la quantité de mousse qui se forme et surtout sur sa texture, puisqu’elle est dense et persiste assez bien.

La première gorgée attaque par les arômes de céréales, en particulier l’avoine qui surprend. Rien d’étonnant si on a lu l’étiquette et qu’on sait ainsi qu’elle est faite à partir de trois grains, le froment, l’orge et l’avoine donc. Cette première gorgée est forte et les qualités de la bière sont difficiles à  distinguer, mais passée cette étape, elle devient bien plus douce et on peut apprécier tous les subtilités de ses arômes, assez uniques.",CaskMaster53

Il s'agit d'une bière qui peut se boire en pression... MAIS qui se boit après plusieurs mois de fermentation dans sa propre bouteille!

Rogue Farms Marionberry Braggot,5.0,+1.6,Rogue Ales,"Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

Bought at Cathedral City Liquor from Cathedral City, California for $12.99, Marionberry Braggot is a mead ale brewed with Rogue Farms honey and marionberries brewed by Rogue Ales.

The smell of marionberries and honey are noted as you drink. The appearance is a purplish brown that pours a low beige head. When light shines through and reflects off the beer, a burnt red shows. The alcohol content is 11.42%.

Marionberries are juicy and tarts the complexion. Burnt sugar and caramel notes are malty and ravishes the take. Honey sweetens and smoothens the drink, and tasted when you lick your chops. Rye compliments the honeyed caramel tone. Maier Munich malt is a backdrop from the burnt sugar hue. Pacman yeast is discernible upon the honey and rye flavors.

Marionberry Braggot is a spectacular mead ale. The marionberries, burnt sugar, caramel, honey, Maier Munich malt, and rye combine together into an incredible drink. The C120 malt is the highlight giving off the caramel and burnt sugar feel. The honey and Pacman yeast give a unique coloration to the finish. The honey, burnt sugar, and caramel makes it come across barrel aged. I ended up cherishing this ale and impressed by its complexity. You will end up remembering this mead for the lasting impression it leaves.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Firestone Walker Napa Parabola,2.3,-1.7,Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat),"Bottle (2019 vintage). Head is initially small, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested). Aroma is moderately malty (chocolate cookie, caramel, roasted grain), with notes of soy sauce, plastic bags, pine sap, and alcohol. Flavor is heavily to harshly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Full body, creamy/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, heavily alcoholic.

Extremely disappointing. The aroma is just plain off...soy saucy and plastic-like. Where is the red wine character that I was hoping for (and persuaded to purchase because of)? Alas, it is not evident in this sample. Probably less of the fault of the base beer and just a failure of the barrel to yield its good qualities, instead imparting these icky off notes. Not enjoyable in the mouth either; wayyy too syrupy sweet with little else but harsh alcohol as an attempt to balance...I'd hesitate to even call it drinkable, but it's certainly not enjoyable. An unexpected drain pour...I really thought this was going to be mid/high 3s sort of beer.",Ernest

Hubbard's Cave Hazelnut Pot de Crème,1.9,-1.4,Hubbard's Cave Brewery,"Initial pour was milky light brown like a yoohoo, but as the rest of it came it was more like a traditional black stout.  Looked almost like chunks or hazies of hazelnut and chocolate floating, uncleared and unfermented.  

Aroma was a beautiful blast of hazelnut and chocolate.  Taste was, well, about a trillion times too sweet even for the richest pastry stout.  Sweeter than an actual Ferrero Rocher candy, sweeter than anything has a right to be.  It hurt my teeth.  So much unfermented sugar, what a waste.  

I mixed this into a traditional dry stout at about a 10% ratio and it made that stout have just a lovely sweetness and hazelnut note.  That's what this is--a beer mixer.  As is, I don't know who could drink a full 16 ounces (and 1200 calories, surely).

Taste: Roast, mild chocolate. A strong dank, earthy, weed-like flavor tossed with Lapsang souchong immediately takes hold. Geez Louise, this is not a flavor profile I can make it through. I don't wish to have a contretemps with my fellow drinkers, but, whew, what a stinker.

Category 12 Transmutation Belgian Specialty Ale,4.0,+1.5,Category 12 Brewing,"Hazy, with a light reddish brown/ amber color to it that has a finger and a half of yellowish soft looking, frothy head that keeps a decent retention to it and leaves clingy, creamy looking curtains of lacing on the glass. 

Pretty decent aroma to it, some sweet, almost over ripe banana and cloves with some subtle hints of pineapples and dried fruit as well. 

Malt forward with a heavily sweet almost, syrupy body to it with solid fruit flavors present, some dried stone fruits, apricots, apples and cherries with some faint hints of whiskey and vanilla notes. Heavy bodied, thick, full bodied and potent like a barley wine with a sweet toffee and butterscotch malt flavor. 

Finish is strong, boozy and sweet but with a slightly woody coniferous hop note that increases in bitterness as it warms, though due to the heavy bodied sweetness it sticks to the background, but does add a bit of balance to the beer to keep it from being completely over sweet. Back-end has some strong aromatic Belgian esters with notes of banana chips, cloves, black pepper, musty coriander and pineapple that hang out on the palate along with some warming boozy ethyl volatiles that linger with the sweetness on the aftertaste.",WortStein17

O'Shea's Traditional Irish Stout,1.0,-2.2,Aldi (UK),"Review: 50cl brown bottle of O’Shea’s Irish Stout: 4.5% vol.

Incase you are confused, the O’Shea brand is made by the Carlow Brewing company for the Aldi cheap discount store, think of it as the ugly sister to the O’Hara’s beers!

Coming in a nice big brown bottle with an interesting logo of a swan, pretty lettering of “O’Shea’s” which looks nice. “Craft brewed In Ireland” 

On pour I get the, as expected, stout look of a pitch black appearance, creamy with a tannish frothy head. It is not a Guinness head but not bad all the same. 

Some good lacing. Overall a good looking stout.

The aroma is quite light, getting the coffee and roasted malts notes with hints of toffee, but overall it is all disappointedly light on the nose.

On the taste, found it quite strong in the hops, a very bitter unpleasant taste for me.

In addition, I got a very strong taste of coffee and dark chocolate. too strong, also a bit too creamy. It has all the characteristics you need for a good stout, but its seems they overdid it a little with them. 

Initial mouthfuls were a turnoff, not nice at all, more a bad IPA than a stout. Very hard to stomach really, disgusting even.

Taste got slightly better in the second bottle, with less lingering bitterness, but less taste too!

It can be manageable to sip slowly, but it’s a bit bland with no exciting flavours and those hops are a killer on the taste buds. Overall it never felt like a stout. 
Also found it to be quite strong in the alcohol, a bit boozey, gave me a slight head the next day, even if it was just 4.5% vol…….",Drinking_77

Taste is candied watermelon, with a Woodchuck-like aftertaste that is sort of like added distillate & sugars. Malic acid tartness. Watermelon juice here, cider is dirty. Crispy, slightly thick feel. Sulfite headache.

Rich, malty with notes of sewer rat.  Quite similar to a Newcastle that had gone warm and had homeless bathe in it for a few weeks.  Carbonation was apparent but did little to improve the drinkability of this thick drunk nectar.  A few sips in the taste started to improve.  No longer could taste the homeless who chose to cleanse themselves and get inebriated at the same time.  By the time I finished the first, it reminded me much more of a crisp coors original.  By this time the tape around both my hands was slowly cutting off circulation so drinking these rockets of awesomesauce helped ease the pain.

Crystal clear coloured body with a thick, three centimetre tall off-white head, a bit tan and quite soapy throughout. Aroma of grass, hay, light metal, some funk and cardboardie malt and a dash of peppery hops on the end. Light-bodied; Very strong pungent lager yeast flavours up front with biscuits, crackers and grain very strong with some light lemons and pungent grass throughout that leaves this quite astringent on the end. Aftertaste is very deep and bitter - mainly from the grassy malts and the lager yeast - these are very strong and don't go away at all. Overall, a fairly strong pilsener that is very typical for an American beer, just sadly, from Macro-producers; This doesn't taste like a craft beer at all - it could be from SABMiller or In-Bev and you wouldn't even know at all. This one definitely isn't worth trying at all, especially as one that is somehow deemed to be 'respectable' by others.

2017 - 150 lbs of hops in each bottle, even tho' Ofests are to be malty.  Too much hops and NO FLAVOR.
2018 - same thing - HOPSHOPSHOPSHOPS.  decent, but horribly wrong.
2019 - last chance SN, can you learn that Ofest is a malty beer???

Nope.  2019 is ALL HOPS, an orange - YES ORANGE - color (their catering to the pumpkin goofs??) and a weak aroma and head.  The taste is sharp, like hot sauce, and has NO MALT AT ALL.

this beer doesn't understand subtlety. It just throws in a mass amount of fruit flavoring in the beer and drowns out any actual ""beer"" flavor. If it wasn't for the disgusting aftertaste, I would just assume this was a fruit juice. And about that aftertaste...It is literally one of the worst I have ever had.

Samuel Adams Sam '76,1.0,-2.3,Boston Beer Company,"This was part of a sample pack that I picked up at the grocery store. I had seen favorable reviews of this beer, and was looking forward to trying it. Sadly, it’s not what I expected. Upon deeper examination, it might be one of the hops that doesn’t work for me. I’ve never liked Mozaic. 

The beer pours a straw to golden color, with a thin white head. The color is a little hazy. But I’m a homebrewer, so a little haze doesn’t bother me (we are talking about an ale, right?). 

The aroma is where I first notice the Mozaic hops. Very dank, and not pleasant at all. Like a cat’s litter box. 

Taste isn’t any better. Not bad, if I drink it fast enough. If I try to enjoy it, the whole litter box sensation comes back and I’m like, “Why do I keep doing this to myself?”

I once had a six pack of another ale featuring Mozaic hops. And I found that if I forgot about it in the basement for about six months, the dank had faded and I was left with something drinkable. I think I’ll do the same with the remainders from this sample pack.",soapyy45

G-Had was originally synthesised by the US army during Vietnam but was immediately banned by the international community as a biological weapon of mass destruction. Today, Galahad is only manufactured by failed states as its production is a violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This substance has a half life and you can feel it decaying inside you.

Delirium Red,5.0,+1.9,Brouwerij Huyghe,"Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Delirium Red is a Belgian ale with cherry and elderberries crafted by Brouwerij Huyghe.

The fragrance of elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, and figs are noted as you drink. The appearance is purple that pours a low pinkish white head. When held up to light, the beer glows maroon and reveals sediment. The alcohol content is 8%.

Elderberries are juicy and textures the mouthfeel. Cherries compliments the elderberries while moderately tarting the complexion. Belgian yeast softens the body and draws out the figs used. Biscuit malt blends and flavors the yeasty profile. Plums are easily distinguished during the finish as an almond touch fluoresces the finish. Black licorice spices the take and bitters the comprehension.

Delirium Red is an enticing Belgian ale. The elderberries, cherries, Belgian yeast, biscuit malt, and figs make this Belgian a one of a kind. This is a sweet beer. However, the Belgian yeast and almonds tones it down, yet the elderberries and cherries still perpetuate. The plum and almond finish is my favorite aspect to this beer. I loved drinking this libation and enraptured by its complexity. I highly recommend trying it. Cold, you will face the sweetness head on. In my opinion, serving it between cold and room temperature is optimal. Be careful as you pour to leave behind sediment.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

This pathetic attempt at grasping at whatever was left of the north-of-England roots (which, going by the taste and aroma is absolutely nothing) is the slogan that now aptly befits this swill. 

To me, Newcastle always stood out as accessible, yet quality brown ale. Low on hops, mellow -- just want you'd expect. I was suspicious when I tried  the Holland brew but found it pretty much the same as the old english one.

I had no idea that they were now producing it in the US and had completely changed the formula. There's some quality accessible US-made ale out there, like Bass ale, but this tasteless, bitter stuff that's in front of me right now is a failure on every corner. And a shame, too.

I took a 6 month break and find it is now a regular old beer. Nothing distinctive about the taste at all. Somewhat tangy. Just an average IPA. I just don't know what sets this apart from 50 other beers. Shame on whoever made this decision.,NoblePupil39
Garage (CA) Cold Brew Coffee Milk Stout,1.7,-1.6,Garage Brewing Company and Pizzeria,"Very thin mouthfeel and lighter side of color for the category. Good aroma but taste is lacking. The biggest issue with taste is the carbonation being soda-like and causing bitterness. Seems to be a common problem among lower quality stouts from micro-brewers who don't primarily brew stouts. This is a huge problem for this category that is not hard to change but would make a huge difference. If you're listening, please don't skimp on using nitro to save on costs. I understand the business aspect but the cost to reputation is much higher. Though IPAs are all the rage now, stouts may later become a trend just as big. And for good reason. But that reason for becoming a stout fan is the thick creamy smooth and very aromatic flavor and smell of a well-aged barrel nitro imperial russian stout. Not this thin concoction meant to keep the price range equivalent to an IPA or ale. I will note that Rock bottom which is also small does a good job with their After Midnight imperial stout.",TrappistChamp31

Aspen This Season's Blonde,0.9,-2,Aspen Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries),"July 2019 Can from Cloud Wine, Southampton for less than £1. Ooh, this is more interesting than I expected. Kinda roasty woody notes to start, firm oily body, some petrol fumes, kinda Belgian, odd. Hmmm. There's a lot of flavour here - not quite sure it's all the sort of flavour I want. This may be one of those beers that really is best drunk cold. Very cold. The flavours are building up in my mouth kinda like petrol fumes. Spicy, phenolic, smoke, bandaid, TCP, plastic, peanut skin, raw potato. Gawd! I think I've had enough now. The interesting is starting to turn into unpleasant and difficult to drink much more. Yes. Enough. Stop. This is the sort of beer that drunk cold in small samples would remain interesting and intriguing, but drunk as a proper drinking beer - a full can at room temperature, it becomes a chore to the point of torture.",SilkTork
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA,1.9,-1.8,Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries),Very disappointing.  Too malty for my expectation of a double IPA.

Steel Reserve 211 High Gravity,4.5,+3,Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors),"Here's the simple reason why this brew gets a bad rap in USA - most beer drinkers here are not accustomed to a what is really a normal (unfiltered by law) alcohol content of a ""malt liquor"", which is a marketing made up term for BEER that usually signifies something cheap and high in BAC content (St.Ides, Old English, Colt45, etc.)
It is actually a very decent brew that offers one an opportunity to enjoy how real beer is made before state/federal regulations get to it and water down the flavor.
And to the idiot (lehers) that thinks that it tastes like coors light but with more alcohol - I strongly suggest you not only seek professional help to check your taste buds, but also stop drinking beer altogether.

Body is medium yellow.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, very unclean.

Medium to full body, syrupy/watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The aroma is fairly meek, and composed almost entirely of off notes...if it was only stronger, it might score a 1 for aroma. Very dirty aftertaste as well, unsurprisingly. Honestly the only nice thing about it is the lasting head...everything else is just plain repulsive.",Ernest

Smells more like a salsa than anything else.  If it was called salsa beer then I would have been ready for that.  After reading the can I then discovered that this Clamato, is that clam and tomato? yuck!  Oh and picante is in it.  There is where the salsa smell is from.

Sweet in typical German fashion. This would be a perfect beer for German airlines to offer during flights (yes, that is a compliment).

Big Drop Pale Ale,0.8,-2.1,Big Drop Brewing Co.,"18-07-2019; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bière, as part of their February 2019 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are alright. Golden yellow colour, clear beer and very rough white head. Foam retention is almost non-existent. It looks a bit watery. It also ain't bubbling a lot. 
The aroma of the beer is soo-soo. Some simple rough malts that are a bit bready and some dry hop aromas. Grassy, piney and a bit zesty and fruity. But, not too strong. It all is a bit like a malt lemonade with some hop aromas dropped into it. It misses some of the soul of a beer.
The taste of the beer is okay. Bitter hops, sweet malts. Thats it. A bit rough and definitely simple. Not to unbalanced. But I expected a bit more. 
The palate of the beer is weak. Thin texture, light body and light carbonation. The finish is watery and short. It has some malts and some bitter hops. All in all, there are some essences of a Pale Ale in this beer. But, it misses soul, balance and yeast and alcohol. When do people start to realise beer just can't be made without alcohol. The yeast and alcohol are important parts of the aroma bouquet of a beer. It is the most important aspect of many beers.

Hacker-Pschorr Sternweisse,1.6,-1.7,Paulaner Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken),"Die Biere von Hacker-Pschorr werden bereits seit 1998 bei Paulaner produziert.
Hab ich in den letzten 4 Jahren mehrfach verkostet und war das schlechteste Weissbier, das ich jemals verkostet habe (und ich habe über 100 bewertet). Hab ich noch nie erlebt, aber meine Körperchemie war nicht mit diesem Bier kompatibel. Konnte es einfach nicht glauben. Bei 4 von 6 Verkostungen waren ein tauber Mund (selbst die Lippen) und ein rauer Hals die Folge. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass ich mich gerade vergiftet habe. Irre. Ich kann es nicht erklären, da dies nur bei diesem Bier jemals der Fall war.
Bei der aktuellen Verkostung (Sommer 2019) passierte dies nicht und ich erlaube mir deshalb eine möglichst objektive (wenn auch nicht positive) Bewertung. 
Sehr viel Hefe, die da durchs Glas wabert. Find ich gut. Süß, malziger Geruch, nicht sehr lecker. Auch geschmacklich ist dies vorherrschend. Nicht sehr süffig. Wird ab dem Mittelteil dann sogar gallig / bitter, sehr unangenehm trocken, kratzig und dumpf. Bäh. Dass das harte Münchner Wasser in Verbindung mit viel Hopfen ein ""kratziges"" Mundgefühl erzeugt, ist ein Problem, dass seit Jahrhunderten bekannt ist - und das andere Brauereien aus der ""Hauptstadt mit Herz"" trotzdem irgendwie besser gebacken bekommen.

Coronado Shaka Berry,4.6,"Coronado, California",Coronado Brewing Company,"Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is crafted with boysenberry, blackberry, vanilla, cocoa, and lactose brewed by Coronado Brewing Company from Coronado, California.

The aroma of cocoa, boysenberries, blackberries, and lactose are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of khaki head. When held up to light, dark brown and carbonation are seen at the surface. Dark mahogany shows when light reflects off the beer. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

Chocolate is moderately rich to the body and tasted when you lick your chops. Cocoa accents the mouthfeel and slightly enriches the chocolate. Lactose lightens and smoothens the drink followed by a vanilla tone. Boysenberry flavors the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla complexion. Blackberries add to the berry sweetness and gently tarts the comprehension. Biscuit malt is discernible as the beer warms and tangible with the chocolate and lactose profile.

Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is glamorous. The chocolate, cocoa, lactose, vanilla, boysenberry, blackberry, and biscuit malt combine into a delightful craft beer. The cocoa gives the chocolate base a savory touch. The lactose and vanilla makes the beer incredibly easy to drink. The sweetness of the boysenberries and blackberries are overpowered by the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla composition. I loved drinking this brew and impressed with this interpretation of a pasty stout.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Buxton Single Barrel Rain Shadow 2019,4.6,"Buxton, Derbyshire",Buxton Brewery,"Renewed version of the barrel aged Rain Shadow by Buxton, aged on bourbon barrels.  Bottle of now almost a year old, bought from Gedeelde Vreugde in Sint-Niklaas (in between Ghent and Antwerp).  Initially thick and foamy, membrane-lacing, deep brownish mocha coloured head, thinning until almost nothing of it is left, but slowly so; pitch black robe with thin burgundy edges.  Intense nose of cold espresso, whisky, lots of bitter black chocolate, dusty old wood, hard caramel, bayleaf, dry old walnuts, dry chocolate cake, pipe tobacco ashes, molasses, cigars in a cedarwood case, hints of Worcestershire sauce, salmiak, treacle, nutmeg and black olives.  Very focused and intense, yet elegant flavour profile: restrained dried prune sweetishness at first, paired with light sourishness underneath and a faint dash of black olive umami, softly carbonated with a very thick, oily but smooth body.  Profoundly walnutty, toasted-bready, hard-caramelly and bitter-chocolatey malt profile, complex and layered, bittersweet but putting more emphasis on bitterness than on sweetness, though a sweeter chocolatey effect surely lingers on.  'Blood'-like metallic effects subtly pop up here and there but feel completely natural, an inherent part of the play; ends very coffeeish-roasted, even a tad ashy, drenched in drying woody tannins and a strong, hot and boozy bourbon flavour, accompanied by hints of salmiak and bayleaf - but also a very pronounced, spicy hop bitterness managing to pierce through the thick roasty maltiness, adding a vibrant, pleasantly peppery effect.  Long, complex finish, very boozy as expected yet somehow this booziness manages to avoid damaging drinkability - while oaky 'vanilla' notes linger retronasally.  Intensely, deeply and respectfully old school, maintaining relative drinkability in spite of all its intensity (a difficult exercise), with a roasty, rustic effect that is only intensified by the bourbon barrel treatment - the standard Rain Shadow is enough of a masterpiece as it is, but this is one of those examples where liquor barrel ageing has actually improved the basic beer.  And with the basic beer already being a 'chef-d'oeuvre', well...  One of the best stout ever to come out of England and reach my taste buds, consolidating my view on this brewery as being among the very best of England, even with very stiff competition going on throughout the country.",Alengrin
Tree House Curiosity 92 (Ninety two),4.7,"Charlton, Massachusetts",Tree House Brewing Company,"Tree House has been widely recognized as one of the top brewers of NEIPAs and has been very influential in the development of this now ubiquitous beer genre - and this seemingly endless Curiosity series has been instrumental in their understanding, finetuning and mastering of every small detail of the hops they use, in a way that has probably never done this seriously before.  After seven years, this is already the ninety-second (!) embodiment of this ongoing Curiosity project, rather simplistically depicting the Spinosaurus, the largest terrestrial carnivore ever to have lived on our fascinating planet.  Yellowish egg-white, moisy, medium thick, lightly lacing and slowly opening, yet generally very well-retaining head on a cloudy (to even milky) 'yolk-yellow' beer with pale apricot hue.  Incredibly fragrant, intense bouquet of lime zest, pomelo, lemongrass, acacia honey, guava, freshly squeezed pink grapefruit juice, fresh dill, wet white pepper, hints of bread crumbs, vermouth, crushed green gooseberries, green kiwi.  Crisp, juicy onset, very brightly citric, lively carbonated but in a 'refined' and non-distracting way, but still adding some minerality to an onset otherwise dominated by sweetish and lightly sourish notes of pomelo, guava, lime, unripe pineapple - with early spicy 'stings' connecting this initial flavour with a colourfully citrusy finish, over a white-bready, doughy, soft maltiness; the nose is retronasally 'filled' with a wave of granadilla, starfruit and guava, but also a lot of sour-sweet citrusiness, with a very expressive, 'extreme' zestiness lingering on and on.  The hops add more pepperiness than is typical for the style, yet refrain from strong bitterness, so that indeed - as the brewery itself explains - the beer ends with complete, refreshing juiciness.  A very slightly peppery-edged alcohol note is there in the end, but does not interfere with the hops doing their wonderful job.  NEIPA is not the style I love the most - but if all of them were made like this, I could easily have one every day.  This is absolutely majestic, the citrusiness has been finetuned into the greatest detail and every single aspect of this beer is perfectly in balance with the whole.  I rarely had NEIPAs at this level of quality - even from Tree House itself.  Amazingly good.",Alengrin

Bell's Cherry Stout - 30th Anniversary Reserve,4.5,"Comstock, Michigan",Bell's Brewery,"Beer #8 of 17 (8 beers on either side of #8000 plus the magic 8000th itself)
Deep, pitch black coloured body with a jet black and oily glow and a nice, two to three centimetre tall rich brown head that fades relatively quickly. Aroma of rich chocolate, roasted coffee, tons of lactose, oatmeal, cream, toffee, caramelised sugar and oh yeah, tons of rich and sour cherries - very nice in the nose with a lot of frobust smells and a lot of complexity for sure. Medium to Full-bodied; Super rich chocolate malt bite at first with some roasted coffee notes (full beans) with a light camraliesed sugar and toffee flavour with perhaps even molasses in as well, but then comes the tart and soured cherries that hit towards the end and do wonders in terms of balance and tempering the deep, roasted notes with only some light sugars and the sour cherries finishing it off. Aftertaste shows the robust chocolate, earthy and sweet notes from the malts with a light hit of coffee and some noticeable vanilla flavours, but the sour cherries finish it off nicely and give an amazing complexity towards the end that hits very, especially on top of a style that is usually hard to make an imprint on (aside from other deep flavours). Overall, it's hard to say that this one could have been done any better as there really is no astringency, alcohol or pungent bites (it's only been aged almost two years by me), but the soured, tart cherries and the large malt profile with caramelised sugars, roasted notes and some chocolate/coffee/oats around make this even harder to fathom. A great beer, and despite the not-so-high scores, I'm glad I saved this as beer #7999 - although I would have been completely fine as this as #8000, especially as a Michigander. This was the eighth beer of my 8000th celebration and it's hard to imagine it getting better from here, but hopefully it will! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle, purchased from Greenville Beer Exchange in Greenville, South Carolina on 31-May-2018 for US$3,24 sampled at my house in Washington on 22-April-2020, as Beer #8 (of 17) of the 8000th Beer  Celebration!",jgb9348

Bottle Logic / Mikerphone Concentrated Solution,4.5,"Anaheim, California",Bottle Logic Brewing,"Bottle Logic Brewing / Mikerphone Brewing - Concentrated Solution (BA Imperial Maple Stout)

Imperial Stout Brewed With Maple Syrup, Aged In Bourbon & Maple Syrup Barrels, And Finished With Walnuts.

Styl: Imperial Stout

Alkohol: 15% obj.

Butelka: 500 ml

Kolor: Ciemnobrzowy, klarowny. Bardziej w  klimacie Barley Wine, ni RIS-a.

Piana: Po przelaniu do szka formuje si niezbyt wysoka, beowa piana, ktra szybko ucieka z pola widzenia.
Zatrzymuje si na poziomie dwch milimetrw i taki stan rzeczy pozostaje do ostatniego yka.

Zapach: To co oferuja aromat,
to ju nie jest zwyky syrop klonowy. To klonowa bomba!
Po otarciu kropelek spywajcych po butelce, cae donie pachn jakbym je zanurzy w najpyszniejszych, amerykaskich pankejsach.
Poezja! 
Drugi niuch zapowiada intensywn beczk po bourbonie wraz z elementami mokrego drewna i wanilii.
Orzechy laskowe wchodz na balang jako ostatnie.
Cokolwiek by nie powiedzie o tym aromacie, to takiego syropu klonowego nie byo mi jeszcze dane pozna! 
W skali RateBeer 10/10 za aromat. Wow!

Smak: Tutaj nie ma zaskoczenia - dopieprzony na maksa syrop klonowy. Nie tylko jako dodatek do piwa, ale take jako dbina w ktrej leakowa wczeniej syrop klonowy.
Ewidentnie czu dbowe wiry, wanili i klimat owocw lenych.
W aromacie orzechy laskowe byy bardzo subtelne. Nie inaczej jest w smaku. To nie jest orzech laskowy znany z piw Cycle Brewing, czy Angry Chair Brewing. 
Delikatny, minimalnie gorzki, bez sodkich posmakw.
Cudowne, gste i oleiste ciao.
Wida to ju przy nalewaniu, 
jak klejce i tuste jest to piwko.
Alkohol rozgrzewajcy, ale nie wychodzcy przed szereg. 
Rewelka. Jestem kupiony!

Wild Onion Bourbon-Barrel Aged Drago,4.5,"Lake Barrington, Illinois",Wild Onion Brewery,"12 oz. can from Orange & Brew. My can label notes the beer is 11% abv. It's stamped with a packaging date of March 11. The company description mentions that it's aged 8 months in oak bourbon barrels, but doesn't say which bourbon, so we'll suppose it's blended from several different barrel brands.
The beer was a pretty solid black once poured. A very thin ring of foam disappeared almost instantly. The beer has an expected warming smell of bourbon, and that's just a part of a complex group of impressions: strawberries concentrate, upholstery leather, and some tobacco.
The taste is very rich and quite mellow. It's got some sweetness, but not as much as some of the more pastry oriented big stouts. Instead, the malt is well balanced between sugar and roastiness, very well settled.
This beer shows that it has been worked on continuously for some time, It invites slow sipping, but would also be a good go-with for a cheese and sausage snacks (okay, I'll say it: charcuterie). And best of all, it helps take the edge off of over a month of self-isolation.",DrnkMcDermott
Founders Backstage Series # 4: Frangelic Mountain Brown,4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"21-04-2020; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bire, as part of their April 2020 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are nice. It has a nice brown colour with a chestnut glow. The beer is crystal clear. On top there is a nice layer of soft velvety light brown foam. Foam retention is average. A nice drape is left on the beer. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. There are some delicious malty aromas. They give a nice nutty aroma, with some nice caramel. Also some touches of toffee are there. Slight roast in the back. The added hazelnut coffee adds onto these aromas. The hazelnut enhances the nice nutty aroma of the malts. The coffee roast goes well with the malt roast. It is not over the top coffee infused. It is very well balanced. Clearly there, but not to strong. The hops give slight earthy aromas. Nice.
The taste of the beer is also very nice. The malts give the beer some nice sweetness. The hazelnut coffee also gives some sweetness, but also nice bitterness. The roast gives some slight savoury notes too. With the hop bitterness, the result is a very well balanced beer. Nice. 
The palate of the beer is nice. It is a medium-full bodied beer. The texture is smooth, but has a slight roughness in the back. Carbonation is average. The coffee gives that sharp roughness I think. It is not unpleasant. The finish of the beer is nice. It is filled with robust earthy hop notes, roasted coffee and delicious hazelnut. The verdict: a very nice and interesting beer.",Gangstergafje

Mammoth Lair of the Bear,5.0,"Mammoth Lakes, California",Mammoth Brewing Company,"Attained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $14.19, 2019 Lair of the Bear is a barrel aged Russian-style Imperial Stout crafted by Mammoth Brewing Company from Mammoth Lakes, California.

The smell of chocolate, molasses, roasted malt, espresso, toffee, bourbon, and whiskey are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a low khaki head. When held up to light, no light shines through. The alcohol content is 9.5%.

Chocolate is fairly rich and silk like to the complexion. Toffee compliments the chocolate and fills the comprehension. Molasses syrups the mouthfeel and sugars the touch. Makers Mark bourbon lightly spices the take and flavors the chocolate, toffee, and molasses body. Roasted malt overlays the chocolate profile and drawn out from the bourbon. Espresso accents and colors the chocolate and roasted malt frame. 

Oak deepens the espresso and malt touch. Vanilla lightens the drink and creams the feel. Honey sweetens the toffee and vanilla combination, and tasted when you lick your chops. Heaven Hill whiskey compliments the toffee and deepens the booze sensation. Tennessee Dickel whiskey is discernible with the vanilla and honey notes.

2019 Lair of the Bear is a voluptuous barrel aged imperial Russian stout. The chocolate, toffee, molasses, Makers Mark bourbon, roasted malt, espresso, oak, vanilla, honey, and Heaven Hill and Tennessee Dickel whiskey blend into an incredible craft beer. The bourbon and whiskey bouquet merges glamorously with the chocolate and toffee. The toffee, whiskey, and honey brightens the chocolate and roasted malt body. The espresso and Makers Mark bourbon dazzles the take. I cherished every single drink and impressed by the depth and complexity to this brew.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Grimm Geodesic Dome,4.7,"Brooklyn, New York",Grimm Artisanal Ales,"Acquired at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $12.29, Geodesic Dome is a dry-hopped sour ale with apricot and passionfruit crafted by Grimm Artisanal Ales from Brooklyn, New York.

The air yields apricot, passionfruit, lemon, and a straw like Brettanomyces yeast funk upon the nose. The appearance is yellow that pours two fingers of white head. Cloudiness is revealed when held up to light. The alcohol content is 5.5%.

Lactobacillus yeast provides a fair sharp tart and lactic tinge to the take. Lemon fairly sours the comprehension and harmonizes with the lactic touch. Passionfruit adds color to the lemon and lactic complexion. A lime hop underlies the lemon profile. Apricot slightly sweetens the drink and flavors the body. A fair straw Brettanomyces yeast funk is tangible with the apricot. Oak gives a woodsy hue to the lactic, lemon, and passionfruit feel.

Geodesic Dome is an elegant dry hopped sour ale. The Lactobacillus and Brettanomyces yeasts, lemon, lime, passionfruit, and apricot combine into a pleasing craft beer. The sour lemon, tart yeasts, and a light bitter hop sparkle on the take. The lemon and apricot smoothens the drink. At room temperature, the passionfruit, apricot, and soft lactic takes front stage. The sour experience is a 3.6 out of 5 for a fan of sours; and 4.2 out of 5 for a newcomer, except it is easier to venture at room temperature. I loved drinking this interpretation of a sour ale and delighted by its complexity.

I usually buy Broadside or Hobgoblin, but I would buy this all the time if I could afford it.  This is the best beer that I had in Australia so far, better even than Old Peculiar or Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier. If it was less expensive I would buy nothing else.

Drinking this beer is just like standing in a Yorkshire pub and getting a local old brown from the tap.  It pours as a surprisingly light brown with plenty of cotton-wool head. On the tongue it is a very foody beer with a complex malty palate that has notes of chocolate, bread, biscuit, and something I cant catch maybe caraway.

Foreign Objects Future Sight,4.5,"New Paltz, New York",Foreign Objects Beer Company,"Obtained at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $6.00, Future Sight is an American hoppy ale crafted by Foreign Objects Beer Company from Waunakee, Wisconsin.

The scent of pineapple, lime, and lemon are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 4.2%.

Pineapple is juicy and provides a gentle tart to the comprehension. Peach nectar slightly sweetens the drink and tangible with the pineapple mouthfeel. Lime flavors the body and adds a citrus zest to the take. Lemon is light in tone yet sensible with the lime tinge. Conifer sap is distinguished in the slightly dry finish and tasted when you lick your chops.

Future Sights is a delightful American hoppy ale. The pineapple, peach nectar, lime, lemon, and conifer sap blend together into a delicious craft beer. The pineapple, peach nectar, and conifer sap set this beer apart. The conifer sap harmonizes nicely with the lime and lemon notes. The lime and lemon profile brings out the water quality. I enjoyed drinking this beer and pleased with its the depth.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The air yields oranges, grapefruit, pine, cantaloupe, and honey dew as you drink. The appearance is a hazy gold that pours a low white head. When held up to light, the color shifts to an orange yellow body and shows carbonation. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Oranges are vibrant and juicy to the complexion. Pithy grapefruit follows and comes through with the water quality. Cantaloupe smoothens the drink and adds its flavor to body. A honey dew hop compliments the orange and cantaloupe combination. Pine is light in the beginning and grows stronger after the cusp of the drink. Apricot is easily picked out in the cantaloupe and pine finish. 

I Dont Like Mondays is a beautiful New England style IPA. The oranges, grapefruit, cantaloupe, honey dew, pine, and apricot blend into an indelible craft beer. The orange, cantaloupe, and honey dew characters are what stands out the most. The grapefruit and pine pierces the fairly thick cantaloupe and apricot body. The honey dew hop and apricot harmonizes delightfully together and with the orange and cantaloupe. I enjoyed drinking this brew and pleasantly surprised by the complexity that interplays into an attractive bouquet.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Brick (UK) Winter Berry Sour Barrel Aged - Pinot Noir,4.5,"Deptford, Greater London",Brick Brewery (UK),"Bottle at home in Hackney - sourced from Rad Beer.

Medium bodied with delicate, massaging carbonation. Quenching finish, more strong red wine impressions, ripened berries, some oaky dryness. Finish is quite red wine-like, though with more pronounced acidity, berry tartness. Hints of warmth. Immensely drinkable. Top notch beer. I really love Brick sours, and the barrel ageing really takes it to another level. This isn't just Brick's best beer, it's probably one of the best beers I've had from a London brewer.",Leighton

Ommegang Seduction,5.0,"Cooperstown, New York",Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat),"Obtained at Liquor Depot from Temecula, California for $9.99, Seduction is a Belgian style porter brewed with natural flavors with cocoa added crafted in collaboration between Brewery Ommegang from Cooperstown, New York and Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat from Breendonk, Belgium.

The smell of chocolate, cherries, and dark fruit are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, brown is noted at the surface. A dark mahogany shows as light reflects off the beer. The alcohol content is 6.8%.

Belgian chocolate is fairly rich to the body, silky to the take, and tasted when you lick your chops. Cherries are moderately sweet and gently tarts the comprehension. Cocoa are felt upon the mouthfeel enriching the chocolate base. Dark barley malt deepens the cocoa experience on the frame. Cinnamon adds flavor to the chocolate, cocoa, and dark barley body. Licorice slightly bitters the take and lingers into the finish. 

Belgian yeast provides a cream like hue to the chocolate and malt composition. Caramel malt is picked out from the cherry and dark barley combination. Raisins are discernible during the finish and become prominent once you recognize it. Figs are noted with the Belgian yeast and malt blend. Plums are sensible with the fusion of Belgian chocolate and Belgian yeast. 

Seduction is an irresistible Belgian style porter. The Belgian chocolate, Belgian yeast, cherries, cocoa, dark barley and caramel malts, cinnamon, licorice, raisins, figs, and plums combine into an outstanding craft beer. The Belgian chocolate and cherries come through as if you took a bite out of a Belgian chocolate treat. The Belgian chocolate, Belgian yeast, cherries, plums, and raisins merge vivaciously together. The cocoa, cinnamon, and licorice accent and color the chocolate body. I treasured every single drink and can see how it encapsulates seduction in a craft beer. This is heaven in a glass. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Upland / Mikkeller Entwined,5.0,"Bloomington, Indiana",Upland Brewing Company,"Acquired at Westons Market Liquor from Murrieta, California for $12.49, Entwined is a fruited sour brown ale (a blend of a 22-month Sour Brown and a 10-month Sour quad aged in bourbon barrels) aged on Malbec and Chambourcin grapes crafted in collaboration between Mikkeller Brewing from San Diego, California and Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana.

The scent of grapes, caramel, and lemon are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark reddish purple that pours a finger of beige head. When held up to light, the color shifts to dark red and shows a clear body. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Malbec grapes are vibrant to the complexion and prominent upon the dry finish. Chambourcin grapes compliments the Malbec flavor with a fair blackberry like tart. Lemon fairly sours the comprehension and accented by a citrus tinge of lime. Caramel malt emboldens the grape body followed by a touch of bourbon. Plums are distinguishable with the caramel and bourbon feel. Oak adds a burnt, woodsy hue with the caramel profile. Figs are sensible upon the malt frame.

Entwined is a sparkling sour brown ale. The Malbec and Chambourcin grapes, lemon, lime, caramel malt, bourbon, figs, and plums interplay into a beautifully complex craft beer. The citrusy lime, sour lemon, and tart Chambourcin grapes ravishes the take yet easy to experience for a fan of sour beer; its a 2.8 out of 5 for newcomers. The citrusy lime makes up for the lack of wild yeast, which was not seen when held up to light; plus, the lime got drawn out as the beer warmed to distinguish between lactic or citrus. The caramel malt and Malbec grapes go hand in hand together, as does the bourbon and Chambourcin grapes. I loved drinking this brew and impressed by the concept used to deliver this sour brown ale.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Wild Beer Dr Todd,5.0,"Shepton Mallet, Somerset",Wild Beer,"This beer is inspired by the Manhattan  cocktail Penicillin. This is a carefully thought out drink that I think really pushes the limits of brewing, but at the same time achieves in abundance its ambitious target. 

A delightful Smoky/peaty flavour that is infused into this drink by ageing it  in barrels from the Scottish Isle of Islay. 
Other flavours of ginger and citrus make this a very interesting beer,

Well worth a try. Wild Beer are an excellent Somerset brewery that take their inspiration from being located in the  heart of region that is famed for their affiliation with Cider.",IPAMonger135

Smog City / TRVE Devil Up A Tree,5.0,"Torrance, California",Smog City Brewing,"Bought at Liquor Depot from Temecula, California for $9.99, Devil Up a Tree is a Foudre saison blended with wine barrel-aged brown and blonde ales, and dry hopped with Citra and Topaz hops brewed in collaboration between TRVE Brewing Company from Denver, Colorado and Smog City Brewing Company from Torrance, California.

The fragrance of saison, funk, lemon, and floral and grassy hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is gold that pours a finger and a half of white head. Light unveils a cloudy body and high carbonation. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Saison is wholesome and smooth to the mouthfeel. A gentle lactic tinge is felt on the take and lingers into the slightly dry finish. The brown ale is sensed upon the wild yeast and saison hue. A musty, hay funk imbues with the wild yeast and brown ale blend. Oak brings a woodsy profile to the brown ale, wild yeast, and saison outline.

Lemon slightly sours the comprehension and tones the drink. White wine compliments the saison and lemon bouquet. Citra hops add a lychee flavor to the saison and white wine characters. Topaz hops lightly bitters the take and provides a grassy touch to the saison and lemon frame.

Devil Up a Tree is a luscious dry hopped saison. The saison, white wine, lemon, Citra and Topaz hops, and blonde and brown ales combine into a mesmerizing craft beer. The saison, white wine, and lychee Citra hop blend is what stands out the most. The lactic wild yeast harmonizes beautifully with the Citra hops. The brown ale and musty, hay funk compliments each other. The sour is easy to experience and forgettable amongst the multiple flavors. I treasured each drink and loved the complexity and depth this collaborative craft beer has to offer.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Nice husky grainbill with soft wheaty mouthfeel, grassy, very earthy, woody and weedy, honey, melons, strawberries, faint tropical fruit. As it warmed it became even earthier, almost dusty, musty, like composting leaves, bitter salad lettuce, dandelions, hot tomato plants on a summer day.

Founders Backstage Series # 7: Mango Magnifico con Calor,4.5,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"Obtained at Westons Market Liquor from Murrieta, California for $10.99, Mango Magnifico con calor 2016 is a malt beverage fermented with mango and habanero crafted by Founders Brewing Company from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The smell of mango and honey are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange gold with a low white head. Light reveals sediment and carbonation. The alcohol content is 10%.

Honey has a syrupy feel to the mouthfeel, sweetens the complexion, and tasted when you lick your chops. Cane sugar adds a sugary touch to the honeyed drink. Sweet malt is sensible upon the honey and sugar comprehension. Mango flavors the body and assists with the sweet tone. Habanero slightly peppers the beer during the first several drinks, and intensifies into a moderate spice as you continue to drink. 

Mango Magnifico con calor is a radiant mango ale. The honey, cane sugar, sweet malt, mango, and habanero combine into a palatable craft beer. Right out of the bottle, the honey, cane sugar, and mango blend together into a strong sweet experience. As the beer cools, the honey and mango sweetness becomes tolerable as the habanero spice grows. The habanero spice and alcohol burn harmonize during the finish. The habanero spice will be stronger since I like strong spices. I cherished every single drink and loved the depth to this brew. There is a lot of sediment at the bottom of the bottle, so be careful when you pour.

Poured out  deep amber.  14SRM.

Nose has aromas of honey, dates, and ripe stone fruit. There are references to raisins.  There are bready, biscuity aromas. There are sweet ale esters. Spice in the nose suggests white pepper, clove, anise.  There are sweet aromas referencing caramel, toffee, and treacle. 

Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation.  There is a hint of booziness in the end.

Palate has flavors of honey wheat toast, rock candy, honeycomb.  Sweet malt when cold blooms into a ripe fruit sweetness that suggests fresh ripe honey plums.  There are pleasant spice flavors as well with pepper and the pleasant slightly numbing mouthfeel/flavor of clove....nutmeg is also present.  Traces of licorice.

Hop flavors are woody, incense, light sappy.

Finish is sweet, bready, with pleasant floral honey sweet-bitter.   There is some dry, slightly lingering bitter that is reminiscent of licorice root and ginseng.

Dieu du Ciel! Péché Mortel (Bourbon),4.7,"Montréal, Quebec",Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!,"One of a number of variations on the Pch Mortel theme by this leading Canadian craft brewer, vintage bottle of several years old; huge thanks to tderoeck for sharing, this one was high on my list.  Mocha-beige, mousy, open head but with a waferthin beige veile in the middle, black robe with hazy burgundy edges.  Aroma of hazelnut pure, toffee, sweet bourbon, clear coffee powder (still relatively fragrant after years of aging), old oak wood, almond, bayleaf, old dusty cinnamon, caramel, brown rum, vanilla beans, treacle, solventy note of fresh paint.  Sweet, dense onset with a light sourish edge, notes of raisins, dates and pear, softly carbonated, deep, full, viscous body.  Massive, layered malt body, toffee, chocolate, roasted peanuts and indeed  towards the end  a lot of coffee, both aromatic (as in real coffee) and roasty-bitter from the beers malt bill itself, both of which work perfectly together (as in the regular version).  Beautifully bittersweet ending with ornamental vanilla-like oak woodiness and indeed warming, sweet bourbon galore with a spicy effect, but the opulent, chocolatey, bittersweet maltiness prevails till the very last drop.  Clearly the mistake to drown a beautiful beer in a vat of hot booziness has not been made here: the bourbon barrel aging has been applied with great care, relative subtlety and utmost beauty.  A masterpiece, many barrel aged impies can learn from this one.",Alengrin

Founders Imperial Stout,5.0,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"16-03-2020; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bire, as part of their March 2020 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are delicious. It is the perfect Stout look. The beer is very dark. The beer is pitch black. In a bright light only the slightest reddish brown glow can be seen. It is hardly anything. On top there is a lovely dark brown layer of foam. Foam retention is good. A nice drape lays on top of the beer for quite some time. Nice lacing is left on the glass. Perfect.
The aroma of the beer can also be called perfect. The malts give some delicious aromas. There is amazing chocolate, coffee, roasted and toasted malts. There are caramel and toffee notes a bit more in the back. Also some nice tobacco and plum and other dried darker fruit. It is a bouquet of delicious aromas, very nice. The hops give some herbal and earthy notes, really nice with the darker malt notes. It has all the aromas you'd expect in a Stout. I can imagine this beer ages well in a cellar. 
The taste of the beer is also amazing. The malts give nice sweets, but also a slight bitterness form the roast and some savory notes from the toast. Quite well balanced. The hops are nice and bitter as well. The beer is very well balanced. Amazing.
The palate of the beer is very nice too. It has a full body and a very smooth texture; both creamy and silky. The carbonation is medium-low. The finish of the beer is very nice. It has some nice roasted malts in it, with that nice chocolate and coffee. There is also warming alcohol, giving a lovely warming sweetness. Also a touch of that bitter roast and toast and hop. All in all, a very nice beer. I love it.",Gangstergafje

Bruery Terreux / Jester King Bouffon,5.0,"Anaheim, California",Bruery Terreux,"Obtained at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $12.99, Bouffon is a sour wit ale brewed with spices and aged in an oak foeder crafted in collaboration between The Bruery Terreux from Placentia, California and Jester King Brewery from Austin, Texas.

The aroma of oranges, passion fruit, lemon, coriander, and a light funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is gold that pours a finger of white head. When held up to light, its presentation shifts to a cloudy yellow. The alcohol content is 5.3%.

Oranges are vibrant and fairly juicy to the complexion. Lemon follows along with the water quality, slightly tarts the comprehension, and tasted when you lick your chops. A lactic tinge lingers upon the mouthfeel in the slightly dry finish. Passion fruit comes through with the lactic and citrus bouquet. 

Pear is discerned as the finish prolongs. Coriander compliments the orange, lemon, passion fruit, pear, and yeast body. Wheat textures the mouthfeel and assists with coriander touch. Peppercorn is noted with the wheat. A leathery funk is tangible with the pear and lemon feel. Oak is sensible with the wheat and peppercorn frame.

Bouffon is an exquisite sour wit ale. The orange, lemon, lactic and leathery wild yeast, passion fruit, pear, and coriander blend into a delightful craft beer. The oranges, passion fruit, lemon, and lactic characters are vivacious with the water quality. The pear, wheat, and coriander are feathery to go along with the leathery funk. The sour and tart are easy to experience and forgettable as the many flavors are immersive. I cherished every single drink and impressed by how drinkable this is. The water harnesses the wit and wild aspects of this brew.

Jester King Viking Metal,5.0,"Austin, Texas",Jester King Brewery,"Attained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $18.99, Viking Metal is a smoked farmhouse ale brewed with juniper and myrica gale and aged in gin barrels crafted by Jester King Brewery from Austin, Texas.

The air yields smoked oak, juniper, gin, myrica gale, and wild yeast funk upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow with a low white head. When held up to light, the cloudy aspect is clearer. The alcohol content is 8.3%.

Oak smoked wheat is rich, imbued upon the mouthfeel, and tasted when you lick your chops. Smoked malt barley compliments the oak smoked wheat and deepens the smoked aspect. Flaked rye softly spices the take and glows with the barley hue. Gin eases the drink and flavors the smokey body. Juniper berries lightly accents the take with the flaked rye and sweetens the beer. Lemon gently tarts the comprehension and tones the drink. Brettanomyces yeast brings a moderate, hay, musty funk notable with the rye and has a light lactic tinge in the slightly dry finish. Myrica gale is sensible with the lemon and yeasty combination.

Viking Metal is a sensational smoked farmhouse ale. The oak smoked wheat, smoked malt barley, flaked rye, gin, juniper berries, funky Brettanomyces yeast, and myrica gale sets this craft beer apart from the rest of the market. The oak smoked wheat, smoked malt barley, and flaked rye blend beautifully and are expressive upon the mouthfeel. The rye and juniper berries are enticing and easy to experience. The lactic and tart lemon is watered down and barely noticeable to the other characters of the beer. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. The gin and water quality takes this to another level.

Taste is juicy tropical fruits, caramel sweetness, stone fruits and in particular nectarine and apricots. Soft acidity and none of the 11% showing up, light oak.  Soft buttery oak versus lovely intense stone fruit. Amazing. One of the best beverages I've ever consumed without doubt.  4.7",The_Osprey

Overall
Very sweet but not cloying. Rich and powerful. Nice stuff. But drinkers in China must be aware that this beer comes with white wax in other contries, while in China market the same beer comes with four kinds of wax at a much higher price.

Cigar City Caffè Americano Double Stout,4.5,"Tampa, Florida",Cigar City Brewing (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective),"3 finger mid brown head. No lacing.
Absolutely pitch black beer.

Aroma of vanilla ice cream, espresso, lightly peated malts, raisins, oats, charred oak and a clear but very round whisky note. 

Taste of the same with just the right balance. The finish is especially beautiful with this grainy, full & lightly acidic espresso note.

Mouthfeel is thick while still retaining a dangerous drinkability. Complex, delivering every stage in a velvet-wrapped presentation to your mouth. Medium to medium-high bitterness. Medium-low to medium carbonation. Very sticky. Punchy but smooth still. 

Overall: Just amazing stuff. Nothing has really been worldclass lately but this just delivered on a divine level. Some US Impy's just hit on another level and are made with a level of craftsmanship we (unfortunately) don't often see here in Sweden. Again, amazing.",EerieDrinks

Unlike many of it's counterparts - this fabulous beer doesn't taste ""Over roasted"" for it's strength it is rounded, and sooo malty.

It hits all the notes that even tempted me into a cheeky half of this powerful legend of a brew, and that's taking into consideration that I am a Mild swilling thirst monster, who much prefers a low ABV Session type type of experience.

And that's my favorite, go-to IPA, Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra.  It's an outstanding amount of hops, but not overkill. Very well balanced nose, with a nice citrus/floral flavor, and a wonderful finish. Easy on the carbonation as well, so much so, that it drinks a LOT smoother than a 7.2 ABV should, and ends up smacking you around, but nicely. All this being said, I think save for the occasional stout/porter to mix with it, whenever I 'do' go pick up some beers, it is, without question going to be the Torpedo.",overfiend1976

Magic Rock Dark Arts,4.9,"Huddersfield, West Yorkshire",Magic Rock Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings),"03-03-2020; can; at home (bought at Saveur Bire, as part of their January 2020 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are perfect. It is a super dark beer. It basically is pitch black, with maybe a slight super dark brown tint in bright light. No light shines trough the beer. On top there is a nice layer of brown foam. The creamy foam collapses quickly, leaving a thin drape and some lacing on the glass. Looks like I'm in for a good beer. 
The aroma of the beer is very nice. It is a perfect Stout aroma; it has all that there has to be to create a good Stout. The malts are nice and give loads of chocolate, caramel, toffee, some coffee, roast and toast. There are some marshmallow notes; or, I should say aromas that remind me of STAY PUFT by Tiny Rebel. I love it. Some dark aromas of plum, some tobacco and dark dried fruits are there too. Hops are nice and herbal, with some earthy and leafy notes. Dark and intense. This is really a beer to sit back and enjoy slowly.
The taste is lovely. Sweet malts, with bitter roast and some savory toast, together with bitter hops. That chocolate marshmallow sweetness really gives it a balanced taste. Very nice. 
The palate of the beer is nice. It is a medium bodied beer. The texture is a bit thin and slightly slick. It should have been a bit more creamier, that would've made it into a 5/5 beer. The carbonation is medium. The finish of the beer is nice. It has nice robust roast with nice toasty notes and some chocolate. The hops give a nice dry bitterness in the end. All in all, a very nice beer.",Gangstergafje

Aroma has some faint grassy hints to it, that turns to a nice tropical scent with juicy lemons and pineapple with just a hint of lychee. 

Moderately sour forward to it with the flavor of lemon flesh and peel with a dash of pineapple juice to it. 

Highish carbonation to it but with a little more malt base to it then some sours, giving it a medium/ light body and mild sweetness. 

Lightly bitter herbal/ grassy hop finish giving it a dry-hopped weedy quality that pairs well and evolve into, without overpowering, the tropical notes on the front end, and leaving a faint lemon pith and herbal dry-hop aftertaste with a lingering floral lychee note to it. 

Excellently well balanced and easy drinking with a great hop flavor that does tropical juiciness and expressing dry hopped character without much lingering bitterness.",WortStein17

Cascade Tropical Embers,4.6,"Portland, Oregon",Cascade Brewing,"Purchased at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $16.99, Tropical Embers is a barrel aged smoked wheat ale with pineapple and mango crafted in collaboration between Cascade Brewing from Portland, Oregon and Beachwood Blendery from Long Beach, California.

The fragrance of mango, pineapple, light smokiness, and funky Brettanomyces yeast are noted as you drink. The appearance is a cloudy orange gold that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pineapples flavor the body and drags on into the dry finish. Mangoes smoothens and sweetens the drink. Smoked malt colors the pineapple comprehension. Brettanomyces yeast provides a musty funk with the mango feel and leaves a lactic touch upon the mouthfeel. Wheat is sensible with the pineapple and lactic notes.

Tropical Embers is a beautiful smoked wheat ale. The pineapple, mango, smoked malt, and Brettanomyces yeast blend into a delicious craft beer. The smoked malt and Brettanomyces yeast funk harmonize wonderfully. The pineapple, wheat, and lactic frame is splendid to experience. The sour is fair and easy to drink.

Russian River Pliny the Younger,4.8,"Santa Rosa, California",Russian River Brewing Company,"Arguably the most sought-after IPA in the world, the almost mythical offspring of Russian River's legendary Pliny the Elder, created in 2005 as a superlative to the Elder in a sense - effectively creating 'triple IPA' as a genre, even if double IPA and triple IPA are obviously a continuum and both are regarded as one single category on this site.  Hopped with Amarillo, Chinook, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and more - a complete line-up of famed New World hop varieties, in other words.  Originally released as a winter seasonal and so far only made available from tap in the two tasting rooms of the brewery each year in February, but thank the beer gods that the Cilurzos decided to try and bottle it this year - enabling it to travel, with so far one single bottle having reached Belgium, a bottle I was very honoured to get a sample of.  If, among all those famous and top class American masterpieces, there was one I never thought I could ever taste, it's this one - so I cannot thank Bart enough for inviting me to the tasting of this celebrity.  Medium thick, snow white, mousy, opening head with a waferthin, disparate 'veil' of foam left in the middle; equally hazy bright yellow golden robe.  Vibrant, colourful, zesty and slightly dank aroma of drying orange peel, green olives, lime zest, gin, orange water, freshly cut green onions, unripe mango, raw pineapple, dough, peanut oil, yellow grapefruit.  Clean but bright and intense fruitiness hinting at unripe mango, green banana and hard pear, lively carbonated though nowhere harshly so; full, smooth-edged, oily body.  A rounded, clean white-bready maltiness is soaked in aromatic, yet well-contained hoppiness, pineapple-ish and (green-) oniony, but most of all very zesty (lime, pomelo), providing long lingering 'green and yellow' aromas as well as a long-stretched, but refined peppery bitterness, highlighted by a gin-like alcohol warmth - and topped with an ever so subtle sweaty note (frying shallot).  This is about as radiant, refined, wonderfully balanced and at the same time expressive and powerful IPA gets: a truly fantastic beer and a standard in IPA in general indeed, even if the hazy New England idiom has meanwhile taken over the larger part of it.  I feel humbled by this kind of perfection - for me, having initially developed a taste for West Coast boldness, this masterpiece is very much worth the hype, though I also have to add that I would probably not wait for eight hours in line for two bottles, like many people in California apparently did a few weeks ago when this was released.  That said, I have no idea how IPA can be made any more beguiling, beautiful, radiant, balanced and intelligent; I cannot immediately think of a better one I had and at this level of 'mythical status', scores seem rather petty - so heck, have a near perfect score as far as I'm concerned, you deserve it.  Considering how bottles are already sold on the second hand market for hundreds of dollars, the very reason why the brewery never wanted to bottle this beer in the first place, it remains doubtful if this 'experiment' of bottling Pliny the Younger will be repeated next year - so for the time being, I'll consider this a once in a lifetime opportunity, which obviously adds to the experience and, I admit it, to my personal appreciation.",Alengrin

Gigantic Hellboy #6 (Trevor Bruttenholm British Barleywine),4.7,"Portland, Oregon",Gigantic Brewing,"Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $7.99, Hellboy: Trevor Bruttenholm is a British barleywine brewed by Gigantic Brewing Company from Portland, Oregon.

The scent of plums, toffee, caramel, and oranges are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark ruby red with a low beige head. The alcohol content is 9.99%.

Plums are prominent to the caramel mouthfeel. Brown sugar flavors the caramel tone and sensible upon the drink. Raisins slightly sweeten the body and adds to the plum feel. Doughy malt compliments the plum and caramel frame. Toffee assists and broadens the dough malt. Sweet malt glimmers with the caramel and raisin notes. Star anise slightly spices the take. Oranges provides a mellow citrus tinge to the drink. 

Hellboy: Trevor Bruttenholm is a luxurious British barleywine. The plums, caramel, brown sugar, raisins, doughy and sweet malts, toffee, and oranges blend into a sensational craft beer. The plum, caramel, toffee, and doughy malt body is beautiful and welcoming. The brown sugar and star anise accent the drink. The sweet malt and raisins give the beer an equitable sweetness. I treasured drinking this brew and pleased with its depth. This craft beer does hit the qualities of a British barleywine while adding its own interpretation to the style.

Russian River Intinction - Sauvignon Blanc,5.0,"Santa Rosa, California",Russian River Brewing Company,"Obtained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $15.99, Intinction is a pilsner aged in Sauvignon Blanc barrels with Sauvignon Blanc grapes brewed by Russian River Brewing Company from Santa Rosa, California.

The aroma of lactic wild yeasts, Brettanomyces funk, white wine, and lemon are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 8.25%.

Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces yeasts provide a moderate lactic tinge on the take. Pilsner malt dazzles with the lactic feel. Oak is sensible with the pilsner malt and lactic frame. Lemon fairly sours the comprehension and tones the drink. Sauvignon Blanc grapes are tangible with the lemon flavor. Sauvignon Blanc wine is imbued upon the mouthfeel during the dry finish and tasted when you lick your chops. Brettanomyces yeast gives off a fair, musty, leathery funk in the finish. The water quality glistens and eases the drink.

Intinction is an alluring pilsner. The Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces yeasts, pilsner malt, oak, lemon, and Sauvignon Blanc wine blend into a delightful craft beer. The lactic and pilsner malt combination is radiant. The Sauvignon Blanc grapes blend beautifully with the musty Brettanomyces yeast. The water quality makes this brew exemplary. The tart yeasts and sour come across as a pleasing 3.3 out of 5 for a fan of sour beer; 4.2 out of 5 for a newcomer. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by the quality of the libation.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Blue Moon LightSky,4.5,"Denver, Colorado",Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors),"Blue Moon LightSky has a very thick, spongy, off-white head, a hazy, bubbly, straw-gold, with some lacing.

Sawdust City Everyday Magic,5.0,"Gravenhurst, Ontario",Sawdust City Brewing Company,"Can from the brewery. Opaque beige/yellow pour, with a medium off white head. It looks odd. The aroma is an absolute blast of every citrus zest you can think of. But there is also a nice tropical vibe, with some papaya and mango, just incredible! Mouth feel is creamy, and spot on, with a perfect carb. Finish is medium bitter, leaning towards high, with a strong citrus pithiness. The zestiness is unparalleled. Bitterness hangs in, but isn't unpleasant. Incredible stuff! I can't help it, for a fan of hugely hopped beers, I have to give this a 5. I loved it!",robinvboyer
Haw River Bifurcation: Coconut Curry St. Benedict's Breakfast,4.5,"Saxapahaw, North Carolina",Haw River Farmhouse Ales,"This deeply complex beer combines a bunch of familiar and unfamiliar flavors to arrive at a truly unique beer that challenges the palate while still providing a wholly satisfying quaff. First off, she's a pretty dark brown pour with a tight tan head. The aroma swaps between cinnamon, curry, chocolate, coconut and ginger. The flavor components are all well separated, but each seems to fa deer in and out in seemingly random fashion, surprising the tongue with each slug. Ends mildly sweet and spicy, with a smoky caramel and curry fade. This is one helluva beer.",freekyp

The Kernel Pale Ale Huell Melon Simcoe ,5.0,"Bermondsey, Greater London",The Kernel Brewery,"So a crap ton is going on with this German inspired hop selection from my favourite brewers in Bermondsey. Anton Lutz whom has earned the nickname der Hofenflsterer invented this strand of Halletau Hop. The other hops in this pale ale is the manadarina Bavaria. Huell (Hll) Melon, also sometimes called Hallertau Melon, is part of the same breeding program in Hll Germany that brought the brewing world Mandarina Bavaria All of which derive from the Halletau which therefore makes them all descendants of the lovely Cascade hop. 

Summary: am amazingly smooth cleverly Hop blended master piece. Very moorish as all good Bavarian inspired  beers should be, that naturally brings in a large amount of Gemtlich!

Wicked Weed Angel of Darkness,5.0,"Asheville, North Carolina",Wicked Weed Brewing (AB InBev),"I would give this more stars if I could. So delicious, smooth and satisfying. If you like tart sours that almost border on tasting like wine, this is the sour for you. Dark red color like a merlot, lovely lightness in contrast, well balanced in carbonation and minimal foam on top. I first tried it in a flight and immediately knew it was my favorite. I visited Funkatorium about 4 more times throughout my trip just to have another glass and we bought a bottle for our hotel. Also, it was a huge surprise to me that this is a 10% ABV, it does not taste like its that strong. I am extremely sad I cant find this beer where I live, would stockpile them if I ever came across it here.",ktmolly
Wicked Weed Medora Blackberry Raspberry Sour,4.5,"Asheville, North Carolina",Wicked Weed Brewing (AB InBev),"Im biased because every time I drink this its when we visit asheville and get to drink it from the tap in their beautiful glasses. However, I did finally buy a bottle to sip later and can still say I loved this! I am very big on sours, especially the dark tart ones, and I think this does a great job in that sense. Tiny foam on top but not much and the carbonation is just where I like it to be for a sour. Truly great. Only one that beats it in my opinion is the Angel of Darkness sour they produce, which Ive been unable to buy in Florida.",ktmolly
Siren Bourbon Turkish (Project Barista - 2019) ,4.6,"Finchampstead, Berkshire",Siren Craft Brew,"Project Barista: for coffee lovers only! Boozy coffee stout here, extremely rich of coffee and roasted goodness. Thick, viscous, smooth, all the power of coffee is here. Pours black, brown head, small and quite lasting, some random spots of lacing. Aroma is a coffee waft first, that evolves into dark chocolate and bourbon. Tastes bitter, very roasty. Its flavour stays roasty and with strong coffee and dark chocolate, very dark. The after taste is exactly after you chew high % dark chocolate. Barrel and whisky show up well, and clean the palate from the coffee before the chocolate after taste. It's impressive how it simulates the real life sequence: coffee, spirits, chocolate, in this common order. Very impressed!",colui72
Cloudwater / The Veil Chubbles,4.5,"Manchester, Greater Manchester",Cloudwater Brew Co,"440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Dark stewed fruit colour, a tad ruddy orange. Decent size and duration head. Tropicana fruit smoothie aroma, orange, mango, papaya/pineapple, with bready undertones. Low carbonation. Smooth, slick, thick TIPA. Prominent citrus sweetness and peely tang, which when combined with the 50/50 bready malt lends a marmalade on toast air. More fleshy fruit notes thicken out the beer, however, with mango, some light papaya, and some dark pineapple. Succulent fruit flavours linger in the aftertaste. No alcohol harshness, but does have a slight warmth to it. This is perhaps as generic as a TIPA can be, but that's no bad thing - this is the TIPA's TIPA, a benchmark for the style, and goes down a treat. Extremely smooth and tasty drinking with well-balanced yet powerful tang and sweetness. This is the epitome of the ""fruit smoothie"" IPA style that people rave about, whether you love it or hate it. I love it, but I can understand if people don't consider it 'real' beer. I can appreciate that too.",LagerGuide122

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight,4.6,"Decorah, Iowa",Toppling Goliath Brewing Company,"On tap in Madison, WI

Toppling Goliath has a reputation for excellence which made this the main draw for a night out at one of Madison's best bars. Worth every penny of the cost, it delivers an experience unrivalled by all but the best of the best. Despite the lines I may have to make a detour to their booth at the Great Taste this year to get another pour.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A deep oily black core permeates the glass and stains everything it touches. A minimal head tracks the long icy legs which melt like sheets of snow on a warm spring day. Plums, raspberry, anise, and coffee hang in the air with a glowing warmth that feels mellow and dense. There's no mistaking the ABV but even so it feels very approachable.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Warm espresso, dark chocolate, plums, and blackberries coat the palate with layers of boozy sediment. The dense flavors complement each other so well that it is nearly effortless to follow each sip with another. The mildly bitter finish continues to warm the throat well after the glass is empty. Overall there is only one complaint - that I did not order a full pour when offered the opportunity.",Brigadier

Does it get any better than this?

Appearance: Light brown with a reddish hue. Roxky ivory head eventually leaves behind form lacing.
Aroma: Dark fruit, molasses, booze and sherry. Right from the off there is a pleasant degree of oxidised character. A touch of vanilla and oak.
Flavour: Similar to the aroma with plenty of molasses and toffee-ish malt and a toasty undertone. Oak and vanilla complement nicely. More gentle boozy warmth and sherry notes too.
Finish: Lingering sherry-like character, perhaps even port like.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and decadent with medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied.

Nightmare Blowing From A Gun,5.0,"Farmingdale, New York",Nightmare Brewing Company,"Acquired at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $8.99, Blowing From a Gun is a double IPA with Indian cane sugar and quadruple dry hopped with El Dorado, Calypso, Cashmere, Mosaic, and Hull Melon hops brewed by Nightmare Brewing Company from Farmingdale, New York.

The smell of mangoes, herbal, earthy, and piney hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy orange yellow that pours a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

Mangoes are prominent to the complexion followed by a sweet cane sugar feel. Hull Melon hops give off a honeydew flavor that compliments the mango. Mosaic hops imbues a bubblegum hue to the melon like body. Calypso hops bring an apple hue and is earthy to the take. Cashmere hops colors the frame with lemon and lime notes. El Dorado hops adds a light watermelon and pear characters to the melon body. 

Blowing From a Gun is a spellbinding double IPA. The El Dorado, Cashmere, Mosaic, and Hull Melon hops combine and emphasize a smooth, melon like body. Cashmere and Calypso hops blend into a pineapple like character. Indian cane sugar stands out and compliments the pine and earthy hop flavors. The bubblegum aspect of the Mosaic hops adds depth to the melon base. The hop bitterness is fair on the take and finish, and drinkable. I treasured each drink and fascinated by the interplay of the hops used. A lot of what you taste is from the hops.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Three Magnets Carrot Cake Nectar,4.7,"Olympia, Washington",Three Magnets Brewing,"Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $5.99, Carrot Cake Nectar is an imperial white stout brewed with lactose, carrots, vanilla, brown sugar, raisins, and spices crafted by Three Magnets Brewing Company from Olympia, Washington.

The aroma of brown sugar, raisins, vanilla, and lactose are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a fairly hazy gold that pours a minimal white head which dissipates quickly. The alcohol content is 9%.

Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel and colors the frame. Carrots are sensible with the brown sugar and bread malt body. Raisins compliments the malt and carrots notes. Ginger fairly spices the take and lingers into the finish. Cinnamon lightly flavors the malt and assists the spice aspect. Nutmeg is distinguished with the bread malt and cinnamon combo. Lactose silkens the drink and makes it go down easy. Vanilla adds a creamy touch to the lactose.

Carrot Cake Nectar is a delightful imperial white stout. The brown sugar, bread malt, carrots, raisins, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, lactose, and vanilla blend into a delicious craft beer. The brown sugar, bread malt, carrots, and cinnamon give off a cake like feel. The lactose and vanilla blend into a cream character reminiscent of the frosting on a carrot cake. The raisin and lactose combination brings a slight sweet flair. I loved drinking this brew and impressed with this craft beer interpretation of a carrot cake. It does remind me of my mothers carrot cake.

Oxbow / Birrificio del Ducato Saison dell'Aragosta,4.7,"Newcastle, Maine",Oxbow Brewing Company,"Obtained at Gerrards Market from Redlands, California for $14.99, Saison DellAragosta is a mixed-fermentation farmhouse ale brewed with sea salt and live Maine lobster in a collaboration with Birrificio Del Ducato of Parma, Italy and Oxbow Brewing Company from Portland, Maine.

The fragrance of saison, lemon, and funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow that pours a fast dissipating low white head. The alcohol content is 4.5%.

Lemon tarts the take while the juiciness is accented by sea salt. Saison smoothens and glistens the complexion. Brettanomyces yeast dries the finish and provides a musty, hay funk. Lobster is barely noticeable yet discernible with the saison and Brett notes.

Saison DellAragosta is a pleasing farmhouse ale. Initially, the lobster does not sound good at all, but it gets lost amongst the lemon, saison, sea salt, and Brettanomyces flavors. The base elements welcomes you to be able to drink it. You have to take your time with the saison and Brett yeasts to cipher the lobster. I enjoyed it, but I wish you could taste the lobster more. Bottled in February 2018, two years of aging brought out the funk, but not the lobster. Be careful when you open your bottle, as mine was over carbonated.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Jolly Pumpkin / Stillwater Losing Our Ledges,4.9,"Dexter, Michigan",Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales,"Purchased at Gerrards Market from Redlands, California for $17.99, Losing Our Ledges is a hazy sour IPA crafted in collaboration between Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales from Dexter, Michigan and Stillwater Artisanal from Brooklyn, New York.

The scent of grapefruit, pine, lemon, and Brettanomyces funk are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow that pours a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 6.9%.

Grapefruit is juicy, pithy, and prominent to the complexion. Hops moderately bitter the take along with an earthy spice. Lemon tarts the comprehension, tones the mouthfeel, and reveals the lactic touch of Brettanomyces yeast. Apricots smoothens the drink and slightly sweetens the beer. Piney hops assists with the grapefruit feel. As the pine wanes, a dry, leathery, hay funk of Brettanomyces yeast grows and persists once you recognize it. Orange peel is drawn out from the grapefruit and yeast combo. Oak adds a woodsy touch to the lemon, pine, and funky mouthfeel.

Losing Our Ledges is an enrapturing hazy sour IPA. The bitter hop take, spicy, piney, and earthy hop notes, grapefruit, lemon, and lactic Brettanomyces yeast dazzles the take and sets this beer apart. The apricot and yeast makes this beer drinkable. The pithy grapefruit and tart lemon blend well together. The apricot and pine brightens the drink complimenting the grapefruit body. The sour and tart are easy to experience. I treasured each drink and impressed by the ingenuity behind this collaboration.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Fuller's London Pride (Cask),4.5,"Chiswick, Greater London",Fuller's Brewery (Asahi),"High formation foam, medium/high density and medium duration. Copper liquid, almost amber with traces of red, translucent.
Aroma is amazing! Very intense toffee, balanced sweetness, Malted and a very very shy coffee end. 
On mouth, the same notes but with a very low sweetness, malted, higher coffee notes but pleasant and notes of toasted bread. The bitterness comes mostly from toasted notes but mixed with a torrois bitterness from english hops, very little resinous and dry end.
Aftertaste brings the toasted bread notes, coffee, toffee, no sweetness, a higher dry and short bitterness and Lefts a bread /malted taste that asks for another sip.
Refreshing, high drinkability but full of personality. Could this this all day! Fullers always being a bottled school.

Ommegang Game of Thrones #15 - My Watch Has Ended,5.0,"Cooperstown, New York",Brewery Ommegang (Duvel-Moortgat),"Acquired at State Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $19.99, My Watch Has Ended is an imperial brown ale brewed with maple syrup and fenugreek crafted by Brewery Ommegang from Cooperstown, New York.

The smell of cocoa, toffee, maple syrup, and roasted malt are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark mahogany shows. When held up to light, a reddish brown gleams at the top and reveals sediment. The alcohol content is 8%.

Maple syrup smoothens the drink, fairly thickens the body, and tasted when you lick your chops. Cocoa compliments the syrupy feel with a chocolate note and texture. Toffee assists and adds to the syrupy tone. Fenugreek applies a sweet nutty aspect imbued upon the toffee and maple syrup body. 

Vanilla is fair and discernible with the toffee, and lightly creams the drink. Plums rounds out the slightly dry mouthfeel followed by figs. Caramelized sugar is sensible with the maple syrup and fenugreek combination. Roasted malt is softened by the maple syrup yet the toasty malt  broadens the cocoa texture. Cinnamon gently spices the take and assists with the maple syrup and cocoa notes. 

My Watch Has Ended is a voluptuous imperial brown ale. The maple syrup, toffee, fenugreek, cocoa, caramelized sugar, vanilla, roasted malt, and cinnamon blend sets this craft beer apart from the rest. The maple syrup, cocoa, and fenugreek combination is delightfully delicious and impressionable. The maple syrup, toffee, and vanilla makes this beer go down easy. The cocoa, caramelized sugar, and cinnamon excites the maple syrup and cocoa frame. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its depth. Be careful when pouring the remaining beer to leave sediment in the bottle.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

High Water West Meets East,5.0,"Chico, California",High Water Brewing,"Bought at Gerrards Market from Redlands, California for $15.99, West Meets East is a golden ale brewed with kiwi and kumquat aged in wine barrels crafted by Highwater Brewing Company from San Jose, California.

The aroma of a musty funk, kiwi, white wine, and elderflower are noted as you drink. The appearance is a golden orange with a minimal white head. When held up to light, a cloudy yellow shows. The alcohol content is 6%.

Kumquat provides a juicy tang along with a moderate sour on the take. Kiwi sweetens and smoothens the drink. A white wine hue accompanies the kiwi. Wild yeast gives off a musty funk to the slightly dry finish and leaves a soft lactic, tart touch on the mouthfeel. Elderflower colors the wine and funky frame. Oak offers a woodsy aspect to the lactic and elderflower notes. Biscuit malt gleams with the kiwi and white wine blend.

West Meets East is a beautiful sour blonde ale. The kiwi, kumquat, white wine, funky wild yeast, biscuit malt, and elderflower combination sets this beer apart. The kumquat and lactic blend into a dazzling medley. The sour and tart are strong when the beer is cold and mellows as it warms. The elderflower compliments the kumquat and kiwi notes. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth.

Perennial Abraxas,4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri",Perennial Artisan Ales,"On tap in Madison, WI

A potent imperial stout proves that it can stand up to any other challenger with a robust rich profile that was well worth the trip to Barley Pop by itself. I'd love to try some of the variants now that I have a baseline to see if they can improve on an already world class release.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Chocolate, coffee, and oily malts stick in the air with a heavy fog. Beneath come waves of espresso, dark fruits, and strong alcohol that warms the air. A rich oily base blends both melted chocolate and mocha into a dense presence.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Epresso, heavy coffee, chocolate, plum, and an oily essence blend into a deceptively smooth body. The chewy mouthfeel clings to the corners of the palate as layers of warmth build on the palate. The results speak for themselves as this world class imperial stout delivers a product worth traveling or trading for.",Brigadier
Northern Monk / By The River Northern Powerhouse Brew Series 2019 007,4.5,"Leeds, West Yorkshire",Northern Monk Brew Co.,"440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Ultra dark brown, nearly black in the glass. Small, shortish-lasting head, only somewhat off-white. Maple and chocolate syrup aroma. Next to no carbonation. Medium thickness, part of what makes it an Imperial Brown and not a Stout. Initial hop hit (Northern Monk is usually good with this; I wish they'd listed the hops used!) adds a punch and some bitterness (mild, mind) to balance the ensuing sweetness of developing chocolate syrup with a caramel tint and maple syrup that are the main thrusts of this beer. Absolutely delish. In the finish, brown and toasty malts make themselves known alongside a cocoa powder/coffee powder element, rounding things off with a mocha tint. Delightful. Can it beat the legendary Founders' similar offerings? No, but it sure stands alongside them. Superb tipple, for me the star in the 2019 Northern Powerhouse firmament. As a Maple Imperial Brown, it could be called a bit generic - but is that really a negative? I'd say that means this is the one by which the rest of the brews in the style get to define themselves. Good luck tracking one of these down - frankly, it'd be a crying shame if this were merely a one-off. Northern Monk, By The River - give us another one, do!",LagerGuide122

Upland Paw Paw,5.0,"Bloomington, Indiana",Upland Brewing Company,"Obtained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $23.99, Pawpaw is a golden sour ale aged on whole pawpaws brewed by Upland Brewing Company from Bloomington, Indiana. 

The air reveals pawpaws, mango, and peach upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pawpaw provides a creamy banana like feel that follows with a light custard touch. Lemon tarts the take and tones the drink. Mango smooths the mouthfeel and assists with the sweet complexion. Peaches are juicy to the body and deepens the juicy comprehension. A hay-like funk is sensible with the lemon and pawpaw blend along with a soft lactic tinge. Oak offers a woodsy hue to the lemony and creamy pawpaw frame.

Pawpaw is a mesmerizing golden sour ale. Pawpaw, lemon, mango, and peach combination colors the fair sour sensation. The pawpaw comes across like guava except with a custard pinch at the end. The lactic feel is barely noticeable until the beer begins to warm. The sour and tart is easy to experience along with the watery aspect of this libation. I loved each drink and impressed by the pawpaw, lemon, and mango composition.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Founders Barrel Aged CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.6,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"750ml bottle from Windsor Hy-Vee, 2017 release, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Deep, rich, complex aromas of nougat, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, malted milk balls and medium-roast coffee with hints of wood smoke and green herbs. Pours inky black with two fingers of creamy chocolate head that laces gorgeously. Sweet and creamy on the entry with a distinctive maple character, turning malty and a bit fruity on the mid-palate with a long, sweet and roasty well-balanced finish, terminating with a flicker of heat as that 11.7% ABV hits bottom. Much more unique and less roast-focused than the original recipe. Ever so slightly sticky-sweet in the back of the throat. Completely satisfying and easy to drink for such a boozy full-bodied brew.

Hennepin's deep golden body floats a thick even bubbled white head that leaves plenty of lacing behind with each swallow. Toasted malt, honey, orange, meadow flower, ginger and white peppercorn dance in a complex melange that shifts and changes with each sip. Mildly sweet as it fades, spicy hops dart in and out, piquing the palate with earthy, herbal goodness. The carbonation is fairly high, but not overdone or brittle. A modern classic.",freekyp

Beachwood Blendery Dia De Los Mangos,5.0,"Long Beach, California",Beachwood Blendery,"Attained at Gerrards Market from Redlands, California for $14.99, Dia de Los Mangos is a Belgian-style sour ale fermented and aged in oak barrels with mango, tamarind, and chili crafted by Beachwood Blendery from Long Beach, California.

The scent of chilis and mango are noted as you drink. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours a fast dissipating white head. The alcohol content is 6.8%.

Ancho chili greets you with a sweet spice on the take. Aleppo chili follows with a cayenne touch. Guajillo chili adds a smoky, berry like hue to the chili feel. Serrano chili provides a sharp earthy spice that deepens as the finish prolongs. Mango fairly sweetens the complexion, smooths the take, and slightly weighs the drink. Yellow chili assists with the sweet mango. A barnyard funk is notable with the juicy mango. Tamarind is vibrant in the earthy spice and lactic finish. Oak is sensible with the aleppo and guajillo chili characters. The chilis are tasted and felt when you licked your chops.

Dia de Los Mangos is a stunning Belgian-style sour ale. The bouquet of ancho, aleppo, yellow, guajillo, and serrano chilis along with tart tamarind and lactic yeast makes this beer a one of a kind. The mango makes this brew drinkable. The aleppo, guajillo, and serrano chilis ravishes the drink yet colorful. Tamarind, mangos, and ancho and yellow chilis provides a wonderful sweet tone. This is a spicy beer, yet it is pleasing for me but I have mention that I like my salsa hot and spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed this craft beer and enamored by the chili profile.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Cloudwater / Track Love In The Dark,4.5,"Manchester, Greater Manchester",Cloudwater Brew Co,"440ml can brewed in England at 10%. Slightly ruddy very dark brown pour, practically black in the glass, with a very large yet very swiftly disintegrating head. Very prominent coffee aroma, with lurking sweetness. Thick, slick, smooth and chocolatey-sweet, with next to no carbonation. The fenugreek does indeed lend a herbal-cum-maple syrup effect to the beer as claimed, to go alongside the (lightly supported by hazelnut and vanilla) chocolate syrup. Coffee notes, however, develop primarily in the aftertaste. Absolutely gorgeous Imperial Stout, albeit (and perhaps because of being) totally unchallenging. 10% beer should not be this damn easy to drink! However, although it's powerful and delicious, from a strict artistic standpoint I'd like to see more depth and complexity from a double-digit ABV beer - which might also have served to keep the fenugreek in check; if there's any complaint I have with this it's that it's just a little more 'herbal' than I'd have made it. Still, this rates very, very highly. By far the easiest-drinking Imperial Stout I've tasted - might not bring all the richness and complexity some fans of the style are looking for, however, it's certainly not generic!",LagerGuide122

Freigeist Geisterzug Gose Quitte,5.0,"Stolberg, North Rhine-Westphalia",Freigeist Bierkultur,"Acquired at Gerrards Market from Redlands, California for $10.99, Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a German beer brewed with spice and natural flavors crafted by Freigeist Bierkultur from Eitting, Germany.

The aroma of quince, rhubarb, coriander, and ginger are noted as you drink. The appearance is a clear gold with a low white head. The alcohol content is 5.2%.

Quince is fairly sweet, gives off a pear like hue, and tarts the take. Rhubarb imbues an acidic sour tinge to the tart comprehension. Coriander is soft and compliments the quince. Ginger is distinguishable in the finish at the back of the throat. Honey adds tone to the drink and tasted when you lick your chops. Wheat grains the mouthfeel and accompanies the pear and honey notes.

Freigeist Geisterzug Quince Gose is a delightful gose. Quince, rhubarb, coriander, and honey combine into a beautiful bouquet. The tart quince, sour rhubarb, and ginger spice dazzles the journey. The quince and honey smoothens the drink and eases the sour, tart, and spice experience. The centerfolds of pear like quince and green apple like rhubarb harmonizes magnificently. I treasured each drink and impressed by its colorful array of flavors.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Nose has aromas of tart Granny Smith apples, and raw plain yogurt.

Mouthfeel is full and juicy with moderate carbonation.

Palate has flavors of unfiltered apple juice with sweet, fruity, tart, light astringency. 

Hop flavors are light sappy, and grassy at most.

Finish is clean, fruity, fresh.  There is no tart, no bitter, no lingering flavors except that of fresh apple cider.

Overall, a really smart expression of the juicy IPA with sour thrown in to offset the low attenuation, and the whole sweet fruity expression that is so often found in the hazy IPAs on tap today.  I really liked this one.  Likely one of my favorites of the evening.  Kinda nice way to finish the evening after 3 big Imperial stouts and a stout wine.",drjoeng
Evil Twin NYC ET Found Home: Edition Scwartzbier,4.5,"Queens, New York",Evil Twin Brewing,"5%ABV.  Schwarzbier.   

Tapped out black.  40SRM. 

Nose has aromas of smoke and wood, and clean malt. It was interesting to nose this next to the Evil Twin Imperial stouts at this tasting because it just highlighted to me how clean a schwarzbier smells. 

Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation.   Sparkling mineral water.

Palate has flavors of light roastiness with a thin charcoal bitter. There is a clean minerality to the palate. Light wheat toast.   There may be some DMS in the palate that suggests corn. 

Hop flavors are woody, minty, hint of resin. 

Finish is medium with a sappy, maybe even piney bitter. 

Overall, a really really nicely executed expression of this lager with clean roast character layered over an expertly executed lager. Good, and I liked this one quite a bit.",drjoeng
Westbrook / Evil Twin The Perfect Nose,4.5,"Mount Pleasant, South Carolina",Westbrook Brewing,"10%ABV.  American Barleywine   

Tapped out dark brown.  32SRM. 

Nose has aromas of grape must, overripe grapes, cooking sake, ripe chiku or what is more widely known as sapodilla.  There are some pleasant strong alcohol references to pear and apple brandy.

Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. 

Palate has flavors of caramel, honeyed dates, molasses, fresh barley loaves, especially the moist hearts, hint of black bread, rye bread, and pumpernickel.

Hop flavors are woody, sappy, with a light pine resin.  The hop expression is a little more obvious on the palate.

Finish is medium-long with a resinous, pine sappy bitter floating on a cloud of alcoholic warmth.

Overall, a big bold expression of an American Barleywine style ale.  Good.  Im still not sure Id age this one, just because I quite like it as it is, a satisfying fresh strong ale.  The rough edges work, and Im not sure I want this any smoother.",drjoeng

"Other Half Droppin' Millibars - Cacao Nibs, Coffee, Peanut Butter and Vanilla",4.5,"Brooklyn, New York",Other Half Brewing,"13.2%ABV.   Imperial stout. 

Tapped out black.  40SRM. 

Nose has aromas of earth, wood, fire.  There are elements of raw flour, wheat dust, dry hay as well which for me is totally attractive for a stout, which is so rare these days. Its probably the PB2 thats giving it the depth of earthy aroma. This is the aroma that suggest wet rotting logs, a compost heap, and fresh turned earth.  The nose has a bit of umami funk that suggest raw soy sauce. 

Mouthfeel is full and juicy with watered honey.  Low-moderate carbonation.  There is a bit of a carbonic tingle on the palate. 

Palate has flavors peanut butter and jelly.  There are herbal flavors suggesting licorice and lineament. There is nice base flavor peanut like a nice peanut butter sandwich or a Thai satay peanut sauce.  There are ample roasty flavors that suggest black coffee, espresso, charcoal and burnt ends.

Hop flavors are woody with a hint of pine resin.

Finish is surprisingly brief and clean with a hint of umami that suggests dashi, bonito flakes or soy. 

Overall, a big complex imperial stout thats not like any other peanut butter concoction. This iteration seems to have gone umami, funky, and earthy instead of creamy, sweet, and boring.",drjoeng
Perennial Maman (2019),4.5,"St. Louis, Missouri",Perennial Artisan Ales,"750 ml bottle from the brewery. Weird to change the blend so dramatically in year 6 of this beer.

Concrete Jungle Ume,5.0,"Los Angeles, California",Concrete Jungle Brewing Project,"Obtained at Gerrards Market from Redlands, California for $4.99, Ume Saladitos is a sour plum gose crafted by Concrete Jungle Brewing Project from Ventura, California.

The fragrance of Lactobacillus yeast and plums are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy gold and pours a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5%.

Plums flavors the body, sours the comprehension, and felt upon the mouthfeel. Lactobacillus delbrueckii adds a soft lactic touch and tarts the take. Mexican candy is noticeable with the Lactobacillus. Saison brightens the dry finish. Munich malt compliments the plum profile. Flaked oats are sensible upon the yeasty and plum mouthfeel. Himalayan sea salt adds a touch to the saison and Lactobacillus blend.

Ume Saladitos is a glamorous sour plum gose. The plums, Lactobacillus, Mexican candy, saison, Munich malt, and Himalayan sea salt combine into a delectable craft beer. Inspired by Umeboshi soda and Saladitos, the Lactobacillus delbrueckii and sea salt blend into a soda like tinge. The Lactobacillus delbrueckii gives off a yogurt like tone to the plum and saison body. The sour plum and lactic tart are fair and easy to experience. I prized every drink and dazzled by its complexity. The artwork is by Andrea Mendoza.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Mother Earth Barrel Aged Four Seasons: Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout,5.0,"Vista, California",Mother Earth Brew Company,"Attained at States Street Liquor from Redlands, California for $10.25, Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout brewed with liquid cocoa and cocoa nibs is crafted by Mother Earth Brew Company from Vista, California.

The scent of cocoa, roasted malt, lactose, and mint are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 10.8%.

Liquid cocoa is rich, creamy, prominent in tone, and tasted when you lick your chops. Roasted malt lightly textures the mouthfeel. Cocoa nibs is tangible and compliments the roasted malt feel. Milk assists with the creamy liquid cocoa hue. Mint is strong from beginning to end and imbued with the liquid cocoa and milk complexion. Rye malt is distinguished as the finish drags on. A caramel, barleywine touch is discerned upon the mouthfeel in the finish. Oak applies a woodsy tinge to the liquid cocoa, milk, and caramel finish.

Barrel Aged 4 Seasons Imperial Mint Chocolate Milk Stout is a luminous stout. The liquid cocoa, roasted malt, cocoa nibs, milk, mint, rye malt, and barleywine combine into an impressive interpretation of a mint chocolate stout. The barleywine, rye malt, and cocoa nibs provide a hair-raising finish. The liquid cocoa and milk blend delightfully together. The barleywine barrel aging is the highlight of this beer. I cherished every single drink and found an impressive beer beyond a variant of a style.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Boulevard / Ommegang Collaboration No. 4 Saison,5.0,"Kansas City, Missouri",Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat),"#OldHopsforOldPops special

Gifted for Christmas from Jenna and James Sepulveda (purchased at Sams Market from Joshua Tree, California for $14.99), Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a malt beverage brewed with spices crafted between Boulevard Brewing Company from Kansas City, Missouri and Brewery Ommegang from Cooperstown, New York.

The smell of saison, rye, honey, and herbal hops are felt upon the nose. The appearance is an orange amber with a half a finger of white head. When held up to light, a cloudy golden amber shows. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Saison is fairly sweet and wholesome to the complexion. Caramel malt textures the mouthfeel and light to the body. Honey blends well with the saison and caramel. Coriander compliments the caramel and honey frame. Orange peel is tangible with the saison feel. Lemon peel is subtle to the honeyed touch. Safir hops applies a tangerine hue to the saison and orange peel combination.

Rye fairly spices the take and the caramel comprehension. Grains of paradise softly peppers the malt body. Oats adds texture to the mouthfeel and easily picked out in the finish. Pear is drawn out in the finish followed by the honey. Perle hops express mint and evergreen notes that are vibrant to the pear finish. Clove provides an underlying tone to the minty profile.

Collaboration No. 4 Saison is a sensational malt beverage. The saison, caramel malt, honey, rye, orange peel, lemon peel, and Safir hops makes this beer a one of a kind. The caramel, honey, and rye blend beautifully together. The pear, honey, and oats work in concert well in the effervescent finish. My favorite aspect is how the spicy hops, rye, and grains of paradise interplay collectively. After being bottled in the summer of 2014 and aged for 5 years, the Perle hops give off a strong minty hue in the finish. I treasure every single drink and enamored by this brews complexity and depth. It is beer like this that challenges the notion how long should you age your beer.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Hoof Hearted Thanks For Letting Us Play Tonight,4.6,"Marengo, Ohio",Hoof Hearted Brewing,"Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is a double dry hopped pale ale brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.

The aroma of pineapple, mango, and cantaloupe are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 5.5%.

Pineapple is juicy and felt upon the mouthfeel in the dry finish. Grapefruit blends with the pineapple and fairly bitters the take. Oranges are discerned as the finish prolongs. Mango fills the body and smoothens the drink. Cantaloupe is noticeable with the watery aspect. 

Thanks for Letting Us Play Tonight is an appetizing American pale ale. The pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and cantaloupe come together into a delicious craft beer. The pineapple and grapefruit dazzles the take. The light orange note compliments the cantaloupe. The double dry hop is barely noticeable until the dry finish.

Unibroue Trois Pistoles,5.0,"Chambly, Quebec",Unibroue (Sleeman - Sapporo),"Gifted for Christmas from Doug Theresa Aadland (purchased at BevMo from Redlands, California for $9.99), Trois Pistoles is a Belgian style dark ale brewed with spices crafted by Unibroue from Chambly, Canada.

The air yields cocoa, brown sugar, plums, Belgian yeast, and cherries upon the nose. The appearance is a dark brown that pours a finger and a half of beige head. When held up to light, a dark reddish brown shows. Light reflects dark mahogany as well. The alcohol content is 9%.

Brown sugar textures the mouthfeel followed by a cocoa hue. Caramel malt compliments the brown sugar complexion. Roasted malt is drawn out by the cocoa. Plums are domineering to the body and felt to the touch. Belgian yeast spices the comprehension and earthy to the malt frame.

Cherries slightly tarts the take and lingers into the finish. Licorice bitters the drink and assists the brown sugar texture. Clove has a distinguishable tone to the finish. Cardamom colors the plum and caramel finish. Raisins gently sweetens the body.

Trois Pistoles is a marvelous Belgian style dark ale. The brown sugar, cocoa, caramel and roasted malts, Belgian yeast, plums, cardamom, and licorice combination separates this Belgian beer from the pack. The brown sugar and licorice leaves a lasting impression and feel to the drink. The earthy and spicy Belgian yeast plays hand in hand with the licorice and the tart cherry. The cocoa and roasted malt adds depth to the body. I treasured each drink and impressed by its complexity and depth. Drinking this Belgian beer is like listening to music from verse to chorus, as in from take to finish. The finish expresses another theme that hooks you replaying over and over again every time you drink.

Again, there's caramel, toffee, and Christmas cake, but also butterscotch, as well as dates, prunes and raisins. There are some firm piney slightly spicy hops at the back, which finish of proceedings beautifully. The mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, the carbonation moderate.

Brouwerij West Hitchhiking Ghosts,5.0,"San Pedro, California",Brouwerij West,"Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $5.99), Hitchhiking Ghosts is a hazy IPA crafted by Brouwerij West from San Pedro, California.

The scent of pineapple and floral hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 7.3%.

Pineapple is juicy and offers a fair tart to the take. Motueka hops compliments the pineapple with a lime touch. Citra hops give off a mango hue to the pine complexion. Mosaic hops imbues a bubblegum flavor to the body. Raw oats are distinguished upon the mouthfeel in the finish. 

Hitchhiking Ghosts is an ethereal IPA. The pineapple and Motueka hops combination is the vehicle that takes us on for the ride. The bubblegum aspect is the figurative hitchhiker while setting the beer apart. The mango and bubblegum notes harmonize well with the raw oats. I loved drinking this craft brew and impressed by its creative, interpretive concept.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Its huge, full of bourbon character, resplendent with dark rich chocolate and toasted coconut, and packs a punch like an angry yak in mating season.  Beautiful oak, vanilla, coconut and chocolate ooze from the glass. A long chocolaty finish is helped along by a rising alcohol heat that warms all the way down.

Unfiltered, to the point of noticeable chunks of yeast in the pour, which dissolve as the beer warms from the 38 degrees of my fridge.  Effervescent in the mouth, big hops (pine nuts, resin) on the start, but with a rounded, juicy, citrus finish.  Great balance of bitter at the start and very slightly sweet at the end. Hides its 9% very well because of its inherent drinkability.  Its an excellent version of the NE style from a promising new Utah brewery. It may be in the Straptank Hazy league (a limited ed. from the talented Springville brewmaster), but since that beer has evolved into a legend in my mind, its hard for me to say.

Saint James Red Headed Stranger,5.0,"Reno, Nevada",Brasserie Saint James,"As my father and I watched the Seahawks and Packers game, we drank Red Headed Stranger, a red Belgian style farmhouse ale with spices brewed by Brasserie Saint James from Reno, Nevada. It is available for purchase at Total Wine & More for $11.99.

The smell of prunes, caramel, pepper, and Belgian yeast are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a copper amber that pours a low beige head. When held up to light, a hazy ruby amber shows. The alcohol content is 6.6%.

Caramel malts colors the frame. Toffee compliments the caramel body and sensible on the mouthfeel. Belgian yeast creams the drink and dries the finish. Banana adds a mellow tone to the yeast. Crystal malt is sensible with the malt comprehension. Clove casts its character to the malt feel. Prunes grows in prominence as the beer warms. Saison becomes noticeable in the finish. A faint yeasty tart is discerned with the finish.

Red Headed Stranger is a voluptuous red Belgian style farmhouse ale. The Belgian yeast is what sets this beer apart; it does not produce acidity yet tart. The caramel malts and Belgian yeast blend remind me of a Trappist ale. The prune, saison, and soft peppery finish is the highlight. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by how this beer evolved over time.

Gulpener / Oedipus Flitspopper,4.9,"Gulpen, Netherlands",Gulpener Bierbrouwerij,"Eisbock de 7,5 % abv, qui est en fait un blend entre le vrai eisbock
de la maison Gulpener et une sour ale de chez Oedipus 
Deux remarques de principe  propos du style de la bire:
1 une bire de 7,5 % abv peut difficilement tre un eisbock .. (Trop faible)
2 cette bire tant un blend avec une bire usuelle, ne peut en aucun cas
relever de la mthode de glaage en intgral que requiert l'eisbock.
En clair, cette bire, pour ces deux raisons, ne peut tre un vrai eisbock.
Juste un ersatz 
Au programme malts d'orge, de bl et d'avoine. Trs bien.
Houblonnage  et dry hopping (trange pour le genre, s'il en est ..)
Mon exemplaire, en format 30 cl,  tait  6 mois avant sa date.
(ce qui est ridicule pour un vritable eisbock  preuve supplmentaire!!)
Couleur roux clair, aux reflets orangs, et clart nette.
Bulles trs rares.
Mousse beige, en nappage fin  1 mm.
Armes de mangue, ananas, clmentine corse  
(Un nez sympathique, mais, faut-il le signaler pour les nophytes,
qui n'a rien  voir - ou plutt  sentir - avec un eisbock ...)
1re bouche souple, avec un fruit  la mandarine, clmentine, 
et une lgre pointe de zeste  trs bien intgre.
Arrire-bouche avec un ct pulpeux agrable, digne d'une neipa ..
2me bouche avec des saveurs toujours agrumiques, trs fines.
Arrire-bouche avec une lgre nuance de torrfi, loin, trs loin ...
Longueur aux belles nuances de neipa, avec une pointe d'acidit jolie.
Jambes fines, serres, longues.
Levure fine, prcise, belle ligne.
Alcool trs bien, en fait, vu la mutation des styles .. il s'est adapt
avec un  double flip arrire pour travailler une neipa ..
Finale trs dlicate, avec une belle harmonie.
CONCLUSION: Gulpener, en voulant inventer le ""sour eisbock"" ..
a en fait invent par le plus grand des hasards le ""neipa bock"" 
grce  l'apport de Oedipus .. et son sour machin (en fait non sour).
Les flitspopper en savent grce aux brasseurs, mtamorphoss
en flitspopper lunaire une nuit de pleine lune  ce qui n'est pas 
vraiment une mince affaire .. mais tout  fait  leur porte.
Comme ils le disent trs bien ""verrukkelekkukkelijk"" ..
ce qui est intraduisible, sauf pour les martiens flitspoppiens 
Je voterai pour cette bire lors d'une lection flitspoppale ...

A dank and juicy IPA using Golden Promise, wheat and Cara Munich malts in the mash for a sweetly smooth body. For the hops we judiciously bittered with Magnum in the kettle followed by Citra T90 in both the whirlpool and in dry-hopping.

Hoof Hearted Belloq American Stout,4.9,"Marengo, Ohio",Hoof Hearted Brewing,"Gifted for Christmas from Renae Walker (bought at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $6.99), Bulloq is an American stout with coffee and vanilla added brewed by Hoof Hearted Brewing from Columbus, Ohio.

The aroma of chocolate, espresso, and roasted malt are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black with a minimal khaki head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark mahogany shows. The alcohol content is 7.5%.

Chocolate is light and smooth the drink. Vanilla creams and tones the chocolate complexion. Espresso bitters the take and flavors the body. Caramel is drawn out from the chocolate and espresso combination. Roasted malt textures the mouthfeel and compliments the espresso. Char deepens and enriches the chocolate and roasted malt frame.

Bulloq is a luscious American stout. The chocolate, vanilla, espresso, caramel, roasted malt, and char blend together into a ravishing beer. The chocolate, espresso, and char leaves a lasting impression. The caramel and espresso dazzles the chocolate and vanilla body. The roasted malt and char applies a tantalizing touch to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuvée Spéciale Sur Lie,5.0,"Boortmeerbeek, Belgium",Haacht,"Gifted from Doug Theresa Aadland for Christmas (bought at BevMo from Redlands, California for $10.99), Rince Cochon Cuve Speciale Sur Lie is a Belgian blonde ale bottle refermented crafted by Brouwerij Haatch from Aalter, Belgium.

The air yields Belgian yeast, lemons, and pear as you drink. The appearance is a clear yellow with a finger of white head. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Belgian yeast has a moderate creamy tone, buttery upon on the lips, and accompanied by a lightly sweet banana. Peppercorn accents and spices the yeasty comprehension. Pear is prominent as the watery aspect grows. Green apples assists with the fruity pear body. Lemon makes the drink crisp and drawn out from the grassy hops used. Honey sweetens and applies its touch to the yeast and lemon combination. Bready malt provides a soft texture to the mouthfeel.

Rince Cochon Cuve Speciale Sur Lie is a spellbinding Belgian blonde. The Belgian yeast, peppercorn, pear, green apples, and lemon blend into a voluptuous drink. This is not my first time drinking and writing (2016) about this beer. From years of loving Belgian beers, the buttery aspect and sweet banana sets this Belgian beer apart from its style. The green apples and lemon colors the lemony and yeasty dry finish. The creamy yeast dampens the malt and peppercorn texture. After drinking this the second time around, I appreciate it more and understand why this brew matters amongst the catalogue of Belgian beer that are available on a regular basis. The only thing left I need to do is drink it after aging it.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The scent of pineapple and mango are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a hazy yellow with a low white head. The alcohol content is 6.7%.

Pineapple is juicy and has a pleasing tart to the take. Simcoe hops are discerned upon the cusp of the drink. Mango flavors the complexion yet lacks body and weight followed by a hint of lime. Centennial hops compliments the pineapple and assists with the bitter take.

1-800-TROPICS is a delightful unfiltered IPA. The pineapple and Simcoe, Mosaic, and Centennial hops combine into a delicious IPA. Simcoe and Centennial hops dazzles the bitter and pineapple take. Mosaic hops gleams the body and is the star to this brew giving off the mango and lime notes. The hop bitterness is moderate and drinkable. I loved drinking this IPA and reminds me of being on a beach in Maui, Hawaii.

Robinsons Trooper (Bottle),4.6,"Stockport, Greater Manchester",Robinsons Family Brewery,"Gifted as a belated birthday gift from Jack Merriman (bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $6.99), Robinsons Trooper is a premium British beer created between Iron Maidens vocalist Bruce Dickinson and Robinsons Brewery from Stockport, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

The smell of lemon, caramel, toffee, and herbal hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a copper amber with a low white head. When held up to light, a clear golden amber glows. The alcohol content is 4.7%.

A sweet toffee creams the complexion followed by a honeyed touch of Goldings hops. Caramel malt is felt upon the mouthfeel. Lemon crisps the beer and eases the drink. Bobek hops fairly bitters the take and softened by the toffee. Cascade hops are easily discerned in the finish.

Robinsons Trooper is an appetizing British beer. The toffee, caramel malt, and Bobek, Goldings, and Cascade hops blend together into a savory beer. The toffee and Goldings hop combination is pleasing and delicious. The lemon and Cascade hop finish along with the caramel is sensational. After spending no more than 6 months in London, Trooper does bring back fond memories of exploring the UKs craft beer market. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and reminds me that I want to go back. 

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The version I am having has been aged in Burgundy white wine barrels for 4.5 years. Amazing fruity nose similar to to the original and the unique edition versions. This one has a significant influence from the white wine barrels, adding a superb dry, aromatic note on top of the base beer aroma. Hints of fresh leather too. Modestly sweet, but not overly so. Somewhat viscous - I prefer a bit more bulk but its definitely not watery or anything. Quite drying - lots of the white wine again, freshly baked bread behind it. A hint of sourness, presumably from the yuzu fruit, but this takes a back seat after all the years of ageing. Hops have practically vanished, least any bitterness that they may have had before. Overall this one is superb.",clongeron

Anchorage Anadromous Belgian Black Bier ,5.0,"Anchorage, Alaska",Anchorage Brewing Company,"Purchased at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $15.99, Anadromous is a black sour ale brewed with Summit hops and triple fermented in French oak foeders, Pinot noir, and whiskey barrels crafted by Anchorage Brewing Company from Anchorage, Alaska.

The aroma of chocolate, Pinot noir, whiskey, and fair Brettanomyces yeast funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a pitch black with a low beige head. When light reflects off the beer, a dark purplish brown shows. The alcohol content is 8.5%.

Black currants tarts the take and flavors to the drink. Pinot noir wine fills the complexion and is prominent on the dry, lactic finish. Whiskey adds a boozy undertone to the wine. Chocolate malt infuses with the wine and whiskey body. Toffee is light and compliments the chocolate. Figs are noticeable with the malt and boosts the malt texture. 

Plums are tangible with the toffee and yeasty combination. Brettanomyces yeast brings a leathery funk to the mouthfeel. Saccharomyces yeast brings out the chocolate while Lactobacillus assists with the tart punctuation. Summit hops spices the comprehension and adds onto the tart and lactic take. Oak applies a woodsy touch to the chocolate malt and Pinot noir wine feel.

Anadromous is a voluptuous black sour ale. The chocolate malt, black currants, Summit hops, and Brettanomyces, Saccharomyces, and Lactobacillus yeasts sets this sour ale apart from the sour market. The spicy Summit hops, tart black currants, and lactic yeasts dazzles the take. The Saccharomyces yeast slightly sweetens the chocolate and toffee frame. The Pinot Noir wine gleams the complexion and is the focal point of the craft beer. The boozy whiskey makes this sour ale easier to drink. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its colorful bouquet of flavors. For the consummate sour beer fan, the tart and sour comes across as a 2.7 out of 5; and 3.4 out of 5 for a newcomer.

Kent Falls Coffeemaker,5.0,"Kent, Connecticut",Kent Falls Brewing,"Bought at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $11.99, Coffeemaker is a Brettanomyces pale ale crafted in collaboration between Kent Falls Brewing Company from Kent, Connecticut and Sacred Grounds in Sherman, Connecticut.

The fragrance of saison, lemon, tangerine, and low funk are felt upon the nose. The appearance is a cloudy yellow that pours two fingers of white head. The alcohol content is 5.6%.

Saison tones the body and smoothens the drink. Tangerines fairly bitters the take and flavors the dry finish. Roasted coffee adds onto the bitter take and leaves texture at the back of the throat. Lemon brings a zest and tinge to the tangerine and saison frame. Brettanomyces yeast provides a dry hay funk to the body and layers a lactic tinge to the saison and citrus take. Wheat is sensible with the citrus zing.

Coffeemaker is a ravishing Brettanomyces pale ale. The saison, tangerine, lemon, roasted coffee, and Brettanomyces yeast deliver a color bouquet to this craft beer. The roasted coffee and citrus bitterness is beautiful. The lemon, saison, and lactic acidity dazzles the take. The tangerine finish is a cherry on top to the libation. I cherished every single drink and enamored by its depth and complexity.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

The Bruery Bakery: Banana Bread,4.6,"Placentia, California",The Bruery,"The Bruery's Banana Bread Imperial Stout starts with an impressive pour consisting of dark brown cloudy body capped with a towering tan head. Lacing is strong throughout and very resilient. Light overripe banana notes peek out behind stronger walnut and roast malt aromas. The flavors are less nutty and more bready with a good amount of chocolate and toffee taking precedence. The beer is sweet and ever so slightly tart at the end of each sip helping to keep balance. Vanilla and oak starts to rise mid glass. Overall, the bourbon is understated. There is no whiskey on the nose, and there is no burn. Banana Bread fills the palate without weighing too heavily on it, and is very creamy with a carbonation that crescendos in the middle of the swallow then tails off. This works exceedingly well to deliver a mild sweet nutty fade. Excellent.",freekyp

Toolbox Biere Du Nord,4.5,"Vista, California",Toolbox Brewing Company,"Obtained at Smart Time Food from Grand Terrace, California for $7.99, Biere du Nord is a saison refermented with Brettanomyces brewed by Toolbox Brewing Company from Vista, California.

The scent of saison, funk, and grassy hops are noted as you drink. The appearance is a slightly hazy yellow that pours a two finger white head. Carbonation has a strong presence. The alcohol content is 6.7%.

Saison is bright and earthy to the complexion. Bouclier hops bitters the take, spices the yeasty comprehension, and adds a lemon hue. Clove adds tone to the yeast and slightly textures the mouthfeel. Brettanomyces yeast yields a musty grape like funk to the body.

Biere du Nord is a resplendent saison. The saison, Bouclier hops, and clove sets this beer apart from its style. The saison and Bouclier hops compliments each other. The carbonation and clove dazzles upon the mouthfeel. The spicy Bouclier hop and clove combination is my favorite aspect of this saison. I loved drinking this beer and impressed by its simple creativity.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Grimm Cinnamon Babka,5.0,"Brooklyn, New York",Grimm Artisanal Ales,"Merry Christmas!

Attained at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $14.99, Cinnamon Babka is a Babka-style imperial milk stout with cinnamon, cacao, vanilla, and salt crafted in collaboration between Grimm Artisan Ales and Mekelburgs Fine Foods and Craft Beer from Brooklyn, New York.

The smell of chocolate, cocoa, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon are felt upon the nose. The appearance is pitch black that pours a minimal beige head. When held up to light, no light shines through. The alcohol content is 12%.

Chocolate is fairly rich, thick to the body, and tasted when you lick your chops. Milk creams and silkens the complexion accentuated by a vanilla tone. Cacao assists the chocolate, bitters the take, and textures the mouthfeel. Cinnamon spices the take and colors the chocolate comprehension. Biscuit malt is distinguished with the chocolate, milk, and cinnamon blend followed by a salty touch.

Cinnamon Babka is a luscious Babka-style imperial milk stout. The chocolate, cacao, milk, vanilla, biscuit malt, cinnamon, and salt come together into an extremely smooth and delicious craft beer. The cacao and cinnamon dazzles with the spice and bitter upon the take. The chocolate, biscuit malt, and milk merge into a savory sensation. At 12%, the alcohol content warms the drink and enriches the chocolate and biscuit malt feel. I cherished every single drink and found an indelible craft beer. This brew will motivate you to have a second serving.

Founders Underground Mountain Brown,5.0,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel),"24-12-2019; bottle; at the Swedish house (bought at Saveur Bire, #24 of Beery Christmas 2019). 
The looks of the beer are perfect. It looks delicious. The beer has a lovely dark ruby red colour, with a nice brown tint. It is dark enough to make it look like it is black. On top of the beer there is some soft tanned foam. Foam retention is low and hardly a drape is left on top of the beer. It kinda looks like coffee, creating a nice link to the Sumatran coffee used in the brewing kettle. 
The aroma of the beer is truly divine. It is so rich and full of aroma and flavour, intense. The nose is filled with everything and all at once. Harmonious. Where to start. First, malts. They are toasted and roasted, giving aromas of coffee, chocolate, some toffee and burnt caramel. Very nice and very rich. Some dried plums and red fruit hints are there in the distance. The coffee and chocolate aromas are enhanced by the added Sumatran coffee. Or the other way around; the coffee aroma is very pure and strong and it is more prominent than the malts. It is the main character in the aroma. The hops give the beer some nice herbal and leafy notes. Not to strong, but that is not needed in this beer style. This already is delicious and harmonious, but then the oak barrels kick in. Oak wood, some vanilla, lovely sweet corn Bourbon, some peat and smoke. It is al there, creating a very smoothing layer of aromas. It is one of the best oak barrel aromas I've had. It goes so well with the roast of the coffee and the malts. Devine. 
The taste of the beer is of the same pristine quality. It is soo smooth and balanced. Sweet malts with some sweet vanilla notes from the oak, roasted bitters from the oak and malts but also nice bitter hop aromas. Then there also are some delicate sours form the cask flora. This, together with the slight savouriness form the roast and toast, results in a perfectly balanced beer. 
The palate is just as genius. It is silk as smooth with a robust strong and full body. It has a creamy lining. Carbonation is low, but the nice hight alcohol warmth gives a good tingle. The finish of the beer is rich, full and aromatic. Filled with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak wood, some of the red fruits. It is incredible. Truly a beer worthy of being nr. 24 in Beery Christmas 2019. The best beer to end Christmas eve with. Cheers and merry Christmas.",Gangstergafje

Whiskey boozes and smoothens the drink. Belgian yeast compliments the whiskey and accents the take. Vanilla is tangible to the whiskey and creates a cream like tone. Honey sweetens the complexion and felt upon the mouthfeel into the finish. Caramel malt is sensible with the honey and whiskey comprehension. Lemon has a mellow citrus touch that is distinguished with the water quality of this beer. Oak colors the honey and yeasty feel.

Cask Aged Tripel is an enticing barrel aged Tripel. The whiskey, vanilla, Belgian yeast, honey, caramel malt, and lemon blend into a savory craft beer. The OYO Whiskey barrels from Middle West Spirits provides a beautiful whiskey tone complimented by the vanilla. The honey gleams the mouthfeel and dazzles upon the cusp of the drink. The water quality brings out the yeast and lemon characters. I cherished every single drink and mesmerized by its vibrant bouquet. Belgian beer is my favorite style; the complexion of this brew stands out from what I have drank.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Southern Tier Blackwater Series - Samoa This,4.6,"Lakewood, New York",Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV),"Rating #8001! Beer #9 of 17 (8 beers on either side of #8000 plus the magic 8000th itself)
Super deep and dark, almost black coloured body with a nice, thin and fast-dying tan head. Aroma of tons of toasted coconuts, caramel, coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, alcohol and lactose - very strong and somehow, exactly like smelling a bitten Girl Scouts Samoa. Medium-bodied; Very strong toasted coconut flaovurs at first dominate with a good hit of caramelised sugars, toffee and all supported by some biscuity malts that provide a nice layer before the very sweet chocolate and coffee notes hit with more roasted malt flavours. Aftertaste is super deep and very enjoyable with a liquid GS Samoa at hand, really standing out with the toasted coconut elements and showing some alcohol, lactose, coffee, caramelised sugars and all of that on a great malt backbone that provides support and is sweetened indefinitely by the milk chocolate notes throughout which definitely make this a 'dessert beer', but it would make me fall asleep, so I can't have this after any dessert. Overall, an amazing beer for sure, and one that I will attempt to find again and again, and I will age this longer and longer for the next iterations - this is a great example of a nice idea, but beautiful execution. This was the ninth beer of my 8000th celebration, the first one on the 'other side' of 8000, but an amazing product and one that I will try to grab more of.

This pours with a nice Guinness-like cascade of brown bubbles down the side. A black beer body with some brown highlights.
The nose is pleasingly like a Dutch cocoa, with, indeed notes of raspberry. The taste does start out sweet and chocolatey, but there is a side of roasty malt coming in after the initial sip. There's little alcohol in the nose, which makes it an easy drink to take down. Milk sugar gives me a milky aftertaste on top of the malt roastiness.

 FLAVOR follows suit with some real luscious fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juices along with a hodge podge of a multitude of other fresh fruit (various notes of mango, lilikoi, pineapple, guava, over ripe papaya, etc.).  One of the bigger juice bomb hazy's I have encountered -- perhaps a bit one-dimensional with the emphasis on juicy tropical fruits but, then I love juicy tropical fruit.

Boathouse Brothers Rua Seol,3.3,"Prior Lake, Minnesota",Boathouse Brothers Brewing Company,"Quite a dark brown-black color, surprisingly dark, from the front; clear dark ruby red with a back-light, under a 1/2 inch off-white-to-tan thick head. The head recedes moderately quickly. The color is more stout-like than red ale-like, but nice looking anyway. Moderate lacing as you drink.

Aroma is musty and sweet. Scents of leather and tobacco.

Taste is as the aroma: musty, peat, leather, tobacco, and slightly sweet initially. This transitions to a finish with bitterness building to balance, ending in a relatively dry and quite bitter aftertaste. The peaty-tobacco overpowers throughout.  While the listed ABV is just a bit on the strong side for the style, the alcohol is well hidden. The aftertaste lingers quite a while; musty, peaty, tobacco, and bitter.

Mouth feel is moderate-to-thin, decent carbonation.

Overall, if you accept it for what it actually is, an OK tasting, malty and peaty-tobacco ale with a surprisingly bitter finish. However, it calls itself an Irish Red, and the peaty-tobacco dominates and just seems out of place. Definitely, not my favorite.",MNAle

Lakeville Morrigan's Irish Red Ale,3.5,"Lakeville, Minnesota",Lakeville Brewing Company,"The beer has a moderate strength aroma; musty, earthy, sweet-ish, perhaps a bit of caramel or molasses, plus hints of a crisp fruitiness, especially as the beer warms a bit.

Reddish brown color, prototypical for the style, clear with plenty of bubbles rising to a ½ inch off-white to tan head, which has decent retention, eventually dropping to a cap of soap bubbles. Good-looking, if sparse, lacing after each sip and as the beer is consumed down the glass. While the head recedes, the upward rain of active carbonation bubbles continue through to the end. A nice-looking beer.

The beer has a medium to thin body, some carbonation on the tongue, and a smooth, even creamy, feel.

Initial taste carries forward the earthy and musty flavors from the aroma, with a solid sweet malt foundation, and some spice in the finish. There is subdued bittering that begins in the middle, and strengths slightly in the finish. The aftertaste retains the sweet character from the malts, but is reasonably well balanced by the low level of bitterness from the hops. A bit of a soft creamy feeling remains as the after-flavors fade. My enjoyment of this beer grew throughout. The alcohol is well hidden, and the beer enjoyable, so drinking a crowler is a bit too easy for the ABV.

Overall, it is balanced and has good flavor. This is very much a drinkable and enjoyable Irish Red Ale, well suited for a neighborhood pub and restaurant.",MNAle

Smell: Herbal, lemony nose, with calamine, sweet creamy barley/wheat notes.

Taste: Sweetish cream of wheat (and barley) with a minute hint of graininess. Floral, lemony, herbal kick that is lightly sour through a nice flush of crisp, drying suds on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Slight, modest creamy elements.

Big Drop Pale Ale,0.8,-2,Big Drop Brewing Co.,"18-07-2019; bottle; at home (bought at Saveur Bière, as part of their February 2019 discovery box).
The looks of the beer are alright. Golden yellow colour, clear beer and very rough white head. Foam retention is almost non-existent. It looks a bit watery. It also ain't bubbling a lot. 
The aroma of the beer is soo-soo. Some simple rough malts that are a bit bready and some dry hop aromas. Grassy, piney and a bit zesty and fruity. But, not too strong. It all is a bit like a malt lemonade with some hop aromas dropped into it. It misses some of the soul of a beer.
The taste of the beer is okay. Bitter hops, sweet malts. Thats it. A bit rough and definitely simple. Not to unbalanced. But I expected a bit more. 
The palate of the beer is weak. Thin texture, light body and light carbonation. The finish is watery and short. It has some malts and some bitter hops. All in all, there are some essences of a Pale Ale in this beer. But, it misses soul, balance and yeast and alcohol. When do people start to realise beer just can't be made without alcohol. The yeast and alcohol are important parts of the aroma bouquet of a beer. It is the most important aspect of many beers.

Brick (UK) BrewDog Shepherd's Bush Twice Shy,4.2,"Deptford, Greater London",Brick Brewery (UK),"September 16, 2019 - At The Rake, on draught.  Looks like a NEIPA - quite hazy/cloudy light gold with an okay fizzy white head.  Aroma is a solid apricot/floral East Coast DIPA with an overlay of toasted coconut, restrained alcohol for a DIPA.  The taste, however - wow - toasted coconut that doesn't over whelm the fruity/floral huge malt body, biggish alcohol, but it just works so well - wonderfully balanced, actuall brought a grin on as I drank it - so good, one of the beers of the trip and it's a crime nobody else on RB had this (I had to create the entry) - this is deserving of another brew, although it's probably a PITA to make, based on what brewers have said about working with coconut in the past.  Solid body, perfect keg carbonation, medium non-coating finish with a long ride-out of toasted coconut and floral bitterness.  SO damned good, maybe the best easiest drinking DIPA I have had in five years.  Bravo.",HogTownHarry

Evil Twin NYC Silent Night in a New York City Taproom,4.0,"Queens, New York",Evil Twin Brewing,"Although they aren't any longer my go-to, I always enjoy to go go back to traditional Belgian style ales, now and then, as they are my first love, hugely responsible for my love for beer,s those days in the 90s. OK this is an American-Danish brand, not Belgian, but hey, the beer is Belgian inspired... and sugared!  This pours beautifully, amber with a firm finger of cream head, lasting ages with excellent lacing. Aroma has a lot of freshly baked white bread, flowers, caramel, honey and candi sugar (canned in Dec 19). Tastes sweet, very sweet. Lot of sweet caramel, nectar, honey, syrup, diabetes juice, candi sugar. But I love it! Probably 2 of these would kill me (12%!) especially cos it's overwhelming sweet, moderately light bodied, and with booze that kicks-in 10 min later. A lot of hyper ripe fruity notes go around the sugar, with a very minor yeasty notes to recall the Belgian-ness. So in the end, a Belgian Ale not too Belgian but a great enjoyable killer!",colui72

Pours hazy orange, big fluffy head, good retention and excellent lacing. Nose is a East meets West blend of pine and stone fruit, citrus and tropical notes. Tastes surprisingly quite bitter and yeasty, that layers up into fruitiness on the second sip. The finish is a return to a grassy bitterness, quite pronounced. Medium body, smooth and enjoyable.
