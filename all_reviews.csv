Faint chocolate/caramel aroma. Lowish+ carbonation. Whisky makes itself known, if somewhat plainly, with butterscotch and vanilla alongside some woody notes. The beer portion delivers typical McEwan's tangy dry tannins with a Marmite aspect (the yeast?), and a slight apple-esque fruity tinge. Really not bad, especially for the price on supermarket shelves, but it's no great shakes as a whisky beer either. No reason really to drink McEwan's Export over this.",LagerGuide122

Taste is piney, resinous, sort of sour twang to it, moderate harshness to bitterness level. Body is full of hop texture.

This is what the beer industry has made of IPAs. lol, the best way to rate an IPA isn't on a scale, but simply a yes or no. this is barely a yes, you could get this on draught and chug it down and yeah its an IPA.

My two favorite all-time fruit ales are this (which I can't believe I haven't waxed zymologically about before) and New Glarus Serendipity. Aroma from a poofy pour that would make cinematographers cry is enormous cherries and a hint of wheat bread. Taste is tart but not sour, and finish is a crazy juicy tartness.

The flavor follows suit with notes of juicy pineapple, mango, and pink guava right up front and backed up the pale malts and a firm  balancing hop bitterness on the back end.

Outer Range Jerry Juice,3.0,Outer Range Brewing,"Frisco, Colorado","Can.

Head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is light yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (flowers, blueberry, orange, mango), with a hint of onion.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

As with Kicker Pilsner, it's too sugary sweet for a pils. Mosaic makes it smell like an American IPA; I'm not really reminded of a German or Czech lager at all. Not that it smells bad...in fact, it's pretty clean and doesn't suffer the big onion stench that Mosaic IPAs usually have (just a small bit in the background). Kinda thin, watery, and fizzy. Overall drinkable, but disappointing since the brewery seems to have some potential (Quiet Depths is very nice, for example), but sadly this isn't a winner.",Ernest

Saints Row Grassroots,3.5,Saints Row Brewing Company,"Rockville, Maryland","Poured from 12 oz. can. 

Clear, pale yellow with a 1-finger off-white head and fare lacing.  

Aroma of light citrus, white pepper and the Chesapeake Bay. 

Taste of light citrus, pilsner malt, white pepper, pineapple, calcium and brine. 

Medium body and medium carbonation. 

The addition of blue crab shells to the brew certainly had a profound effect. Upon opening the can, the aroma was immediately recognizable as a saison. Saison characteristics come through strongly in flavor as does pilsner malt. But, you can’t miss the Chesapeake shoreline one the aroma or the pleasant saltiness and calcium in the flavor. I would have like a little more wild yeast character typical of a saison, but this also has its appeal.",MadRobin

Coronado Shaka Berry,4.6,Coronado Brewing Company,"Coronado, California","Acquired at La Bodega from Riverside, California for $4.99, Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is crafted with boysenberry, blackberry, vanilla, cocoa, and lactose brewed by Coronado Brewing Company from Coronado, California.

The aroma of cocoa, boysenberries, blackberries, and lactose are noted as you drink. The appearance is pitch black that pours a finger of khaki head. When held up to light, dark brown and carbonation are seen at the surface. Dark mahogany shows when light reflects off the beer. The alcohol content is 10.5%.

Chocolate is moderately rich to the body and tasted when you lick your chops. Cocoa accents the mouthfeel and slightly enriches the chocolate. Lactose lightens and smoothens the drink followed by a vanilla tone. Boysenberry flavors the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla complexion. Blackberries add to the berry sweetness and gently tarts the comprehension. Biscuit malt is discernible as the beer warms and tangible with the chocolate and lactose profile.

Shaka Berry Pastry Stout is glamorous. The chocolate, cocoa, lactose, vanilla, boysenberry, blackberry, and biscuit malt combine into a delightful craft beer. The cocoa gives the chocolate base a savory touch. The lactose and vanilla makes the beer incredibly easy to drink. The sweetness of the boysenberries and blackberries are overpowered by the chocolate, lactose, and vanilla composition. I loved drinking this brew and impressed with this interpretation of a pasty stout.

Cheers. Prost. Drink for the love of beer.

Epic Big Bad Baptist - Quintuple Barrel,4.4,Epic Brewing Company (UT/CO),"Salt Lake City, Utah","Pours a pitch-black coloration with a medium, frothy, mocha-colored head. Smells rather intoxicating of quite roasted, caramel malt, dark, bitter chocolate and coffee and lighter coconut, toffee and vanilla, as well as some oak and brandy/bourbon accents. Taste is an excellent balance of quite roasted, slightly caramelly malt, a huge dark, bitter and roasted chocolate and coffee presence, with the chocolate feeling even more prominent, and ligher notes of toasted coconut, almonds, licorice and vanilla, as well as a strong barrel presence of both brandy and bourbon, with the brandy feeling a little prominent, some oak and a good dose of salted caramel coming through in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, coconut and salted caramel lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.

This is just a fantastic stout with a huge depth of flavor and complexity, while still being superbly balanced, with quite a roasted and bitter character and only very little sweetness being provided by the salted caramel here. The huge dark and bitter chocolate and coffee notes play right into this balance with a very rich presence and the coffee also providing subtle spicy accents, while the toasted coconut and almonds actually remain firmly in the background, with the coconut coming through a little more though, while also feeling rather toasted and not as sweet as in some stouts. The rich barrel profile really is the coup de grace here though, with the brandy coming through particularly with a sort of fruity, mildly sweet and boozy presence along with the more typical bourbon barrel notes of oak and vanilla. Mind you, I'm not a huge fan of sweet and boozy stouts at all and these brandy notes are rather soft and subtle here, working well with the overall balance. I often find these 650ml bottles of 12+% ABV stout overwhelming and difficult to finish, but I will be savoring every last drop of this.",snowcrash000

Light carbonation. Slightly thick, sticky, almost flat texture. 

Flavor is intense with a strong sweetness followed by a medium strong bitterness (a bit surprising when I take the aroma into account). Aftertaste is sweetish with a bitter undercurrent. Lingers for a while. Finish is semi-dry.

Toffee aroma with a hint of sultana (and maybe even minute sulphur?). Lowish carbonation, but feels muted due to the fairly thick consistency. Tangy dark and dried fruits are the star of the show here, raisin and even cherry make themselves known, and are lifted up somewhat with a beleaguered toffee malt. Has a sort of Marmite on toast character, what with the tangy fruit elements and slight dry tannins. If you squint there's even a woody note in here. Not bad at all, and great bang for your buck ABV-wise on supermarket shelves - if that's a concern for you! No alcohol burn.

Trillium plane over car over train over boat,3.7,Trillium Brewing Company,"Boston, Massachusetts","'Quadrupel IPA' of the hazy kind by NEIPA's grandmasters in Boston, Massachusetts; can from De Hopduvel.  Thinnish and immediately open, egg-white, irregular, lightly lacing head on a deeply cloudy peach-orange blonde beer, looking a bit like passionfruit juice from a jar.  Aroma of blood orange juice, passionfruit, overripe papaja, mango, Screwdriver, diesel, gin, hints of pink peppercorns, green olives, soggy biscuit, limoncello, lime peel, lemon verbena.  Sweet onset with light sourish touch, a huge wave of passionfruit-, papaja- and mango-like tropical juiciness with a refreshingly citrusy blood orange effect at the sides, gently carbonated with full, soft body.  Cake-doughy and biscuity malts completely overwhelmed by juicy, tropical hoppiness, sweet mango, papaja and passionfruit again with that orangey side, followed by a wodka-like alcohol glow as well as some overripe onion- and even diesel-like dankness.  Enormously juicy and tropical, this tastes more like tropical fruit juice spiked with wodka than like beer - which for me is too cocktail-like.  Could use a bit more citric zestiness and hop bitterness (not too much of course - we are still talking NEIPA here) to bring this tropical fruit cocktail effect into balance.  Not Trillium's most complex or impressive hazy IPA so far for me, but still an interesting one, venturing into extreme 'tropicality' and pushing the boundaries of the hazy IPA idiom when it comes to alcohol strength; I'm sure all those young haze geeks out there will love this.",Alengrin

Appearance: Pleasantly, responsibly hazy, light yellow-orange in color with an inch of soft-looking, white foam.

Smell: Citrusy, lightly tropical aroma with white grapefruit and a snap of tangerine aided by pineapple and a thin sliver of mango. Modest maltiness with a subtle showing of rustic raw grains.

Taste: Light-leaning malt profile, a nibble of humble cracker with the merest kiss of sweetness. It quickly dries out, with measured citrus fruits backed by lesser tropical notes and a nice awakening acidity. Tiny bit of biting rind. Bitterness, overall, feels really mellow. Ultra faint oat creaminess felt on the swallow.

Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.0,Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan,"Freising, Bavaria","1 pint 0.9 oz. bottle

AROMA:  Sweet with scents of apricot, banana, bubblegum and undertones of lemon.

APPEARANCE:  Pours a hazy light-gold with a frothy white head that dissipates slowly.

TASTE:  Softly sweet with flavors of banana and a hint of cloves.

MOUTHFEEL:  Medium-bodied with a slightly slick, but sticky texture.  Carbonation is mild.  There is a hint of soft-bitterness in the finish.

OVERALL:  I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised with its overall ""softness"".  And by that I mean, in all aspects (feel, taste, smell, etc.) the attributes always maintained a nice balance and never underwhelmed (e.g. needing to strain your senses just to detect something), nor overwhelmed (e.g. having your senses inflicted with blunt-force trauma).  Additionally, I found that the flavor of this beer doesn't really change much as it warms to room temperature.  To me, that is impressive, as I've found that most sweet-ish beers tend to get much sweeter as they warm.  All-in-all, I can't really find anything to complain about other than I don't have another one waiting for me in the fridge.",ironprog

La Rulles Cré Tonnerre,3.0,Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles,"Rulles, Belgium","Copenhagen 26/4 2020. 75 cl capped bottle from Belgisk Bryg, Emdrup Mosevej, Kbh NV. A merry band, music playing pirates on the label. Shall dark rum for all time be associated with Captain Morgan?

Pours unclear, golden yellow with a big fluffy white head. Fairly stable. Settles as thin layer of foam just covering the surface of the beer. Crawling up the side of the glass. Substantial lacing. 

Aroma is moderately intense with a sweet, malty odor with  very light touch of rum. Caramel, toffee, butter. Light odor of sweet, dark alcohol chiming in. 

Light carbonation. Slightly thick, oily, almost flat texture. 

Flavor is medium intense and has a fairly strong sweetness followed by a moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and lingers for a bit. Tepid finish. 

Not  bad beer. But a bit of an exaggeration to call this a ""Bière au Rhum"". I would rather call it a very malty brew with a faint tang of rum. Can hardly justify the band of merry pirates on the label.",DraftDodger

Hmmm... Again a typical Adroit Theory brew with seemingly light body. What works well with all their Big Beers, i.e. high drinkability due to a seemingly light body, somehow constructed by a method of parallelization of alcohol and flavour partition, with the alcohol working somehow as ""thinner"", doesn't work as well with their Pale Ales.

The aroma is ripe tropical fruits, apricot, mango, peach, citrus peel, nip of pine and some gummy bears. The taste is crisp, dry, light bitterness, pithy, soda water with orange peel, kind of soapy, pine and grass with a dry, rindy finish. Light body and moderate, prickly carbonation.

13.8%ABV bottled 20SEPT18
Pitch black, opaque, small tan head persists.
Aroma is very roasty; blackened toast, coffee grounds, cacoa nibs, oaken vanilla, old wood, lots of spice & dried fruits.
Thick body, oily, rather boozy, low carbonation, not hugely thick despite the weight of it.
A mish-mash of things going on; not a great clarity of flavours - oaken vanilla pretty big, as is bitter chocolate maltiness, toasty waffle (bourbon barrel) character, dried fruits; more emerges as it warms, yet still a bit all over the shop despite its age - good whack of booze, fairly bitter.
Seems to tick a heap of boxes, but seems to lack the finesse & polished quality of the best beers of this style - still, very bloody good!",Muggus69

Odd Breed Wild Ales In Memoriam,3.3,Odd Breed Wild Ales,"Pompano Beach, Florida","750 mL bottle.  Clear golden with a big white head that dissipates quickly.  Smells of oak, lemon acidity, and grassy hops.  Tastes of the grassy and lightly skunky hops up front with a sharp lemony acidity.  Oak really takes over or maybe it just makes the hops seem chewier and grassier.  Astringent and oaky back end.  Moderate sourness, not quite as high as other Odd Breeds. After letting it warm a bit, some malt flavors open up, but the hops remain the single dominant flavor.  I guess that's the point, but I don't think the aged character makes them that dynamic.",ctipping

It's black, opaque, small tan head hangs around for a bit.
Aroma is richly roasty; burnt meat, toast, blackened things, deep roast coffee, cocoa, Porty undertones suggesting a big booze without giving away too much.
Reasonably thick, slick, slightly warming palate but really doesn't give the indication of how bloody strong it is!!
Very malty - lots of like burnt biscuit and blackened bread crust, fairly high bitterness, raisins, cocoa, coffee grinds....all like a distraction to the elephant in the room that this beer is potentially a fortified wine! But yes, you get booozy warmth on the finish, fair bitterness too; but it's no different from what you'd get from a 12% beer!

The aroma is all maple syrup sweetness here along with lighter notes of dark chocolate and cinnamon over a lightly roasted malt base, but the maple syrup takes center stage.  The flavor follows and is again loaded up front with the maple syrup sweetness, some lighter notes of dark chocolate, and just a touch of roast and bitterness on the back end.  Medium bodied and sticky sweet with moderate carbonation that leads to a heavily cloying maple syrup, light dark chocolate, and a touch of roast on the finish.

Lingering mossy astringency on the top of the tongue in the finish. Good effervescence. Only ~7% ABV, but it gives a boozier impression.

Untitled Art / Speciation Michelada,2.8,Untitled Art,"Waunakee, Wisconsin","16 ounce can

I'm not sure why I picked up this single but the strange blend of flavors put me off any future micheladas. Perhaps it would have been better if I could have split it multiple ways just so I didn't have to endure eight ounces. 

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A rich coppery foundation supports a pillar of sticky head. Spicy tomato, malt, and herbs stray dangerously close to the territory of beers like Short's ill fated pizza experiment. In fact it almost resembles carbonated V8.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Tomato, spice, and a biting bubbly feel shock the palate to attention. The sharp transition then cuts over to a finish centered around malts. A mediocre experience from start to finish offers little excitement and nothing compelling past the first few sips.",Brigadier
Bell's III: O Captain! My Captain! (Leaves of Grass Series),3.4,Bell's Brewery,"Comstock, Michigan","12 ounce bottle

Whenever a brewery like Bell's begins a new series it catches my eye. This polished lager met most expectations even though stylistically it might not be my favorite. I'll have to see if I can find any similar beers for comparison's sake.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A mahogany body gleams with a soft inner warmth. Licorice, malt, and a sprinkling of ash sweeten the air with a profile that was initially unexpected.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Chewy half melted chocolate bars, ash, and anise cool the tongue. The transition eases into a dense woody profile that centers around malt. Traces of coffee add a unique twist to the gentle finish. While hard to pin down this does enough to be a worthwhile session offering.",Brigadier
Wild Ambition Ulpia Severina,3.9,Wild Ambition Brewing,"Kelowna, British Columbia","Bottle from Legacy. Pinkish-purple colour with no head.

O'so 2 Milkshake Lunch,3.7,O'so Brewing Company,"Plover, Wisconsin","16 ounce can

An amped up milkshake IPA takes everything except the bitterness to the next level. As a result it offers a filling and heady experience that provides a regional take on the popular style.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Vanilla yogurt, creamy malt balls, and a doughy haze stick in the air with a foggy profile. From within the dense bronze base the lean ivory head surges upwards before collapsing after a minute or two.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Fruity notes amplify and double down the intensity that centers around a core of fresh yeast, light chocolate, and citrus. The transition takes on the character of velvet cake which lingers into the chewy finish. As a change of pace from their sours this might be one of my favorite O'so releases in recent memory.",Brigadier

Another gorgeous cask pour - clear copper-amber with a decent lasting creamy beige/tan head.

Just ... no.",HogTownHarry
Karben4 Champagne Tortoise,3.5,Karben4 Brewing,"Madison, Wisconsin","12 ounce bottle

A benchmark beer for Karben4, this English style mild ale gets the job done in typical fashion for the brewery with an on the nose profile and little extra. It might not be standout but if you're seeking a regional Midwest take on an old world style then it should suffice.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
Moderately toasted wheat bread splashed with melted Hershey's kisses pair well with the dry mellow hops. The rich brown base supports a lean ivory head that is laid back and subtle.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Malty toast tickles the tongue with a splash of noble hops. The light refreshing mouthfeel gives way to the gentle finish.

Slightly sweet yeast smell with spice consistent with Belgian ale, but not strong. Equal pleasing and symmetric taste, but clove/spice very subtle and not appreciable to me.

Sweet orange, light tart / zesty lime.  Blood one comes through nicely and works well for this type of beer.  ABV is completely hidden here, basically tastes like if you squeezed a couple of limes into a glass of orange juice.  Tingly, just tart enough to balance the sweetness.  Gimmick beer for sure, but a gimmick beer well done.

I was really curious to try my first Pale Ale from Adroit Theory since all those double-digit abv beers I had so far from them (Barley Wines, Quadrupels, Impy Stouts) were really outstanding and showed a unique and typical character that mark this brewery. Here I find again high drinkability, which has been a constant factor in all Adroit brews, but neither an intensity of hop flavours nor anything else in unknown quality to push the rating score on a top level. No disappointment, but nothing special either.",Idiosynkrasie

Erdinger Weissbier,2.9,Erdinger Weissbräu,"Erding, Bavaria","(500ml bottle, Berlin. 25 Apr 2020)
AROMA: light grain/wheat, yeast, biscuit, some perfume, not much of the banana/cloves that some wheat beers have
APPEARANCE: tall white head, hazy dirty yellow, foam does linger and leaves a fair amount of residual
TASTE: tastes like a hearty lager, grainy, green, grassy, leaning towards non-roasted grain/wheat, a hint of citrus at first but builds up as the beer warms up, some coffee hidden underneath on the finish, 
PALATE: quite sparkly and fizzy, so a bit biting on the front with fizz persisting for a bit. approaching medium body, after the sharpness, there is some roundness and oiliness,  

OVERALL: nose is light and underwhelming but nuanced, good looking beer, mouth feel is a bit too sharp for me, flavors focus on citrus and grass and light grain. It is a quality beer that tastes like it was made well, but the bite/astringency is a tad too much for me. As it warms up and flattens out, it does get better.",Rex_Remes

There is a decent piney fresh citrus vibe here but it plays second fiddle to a slightly savoury green hop vibe, not filthy but suppressing the natural fruity hop brightness of this stellar trio. Perhaps this is the same batch of Citra that Cloudwater recently showcased and was too dirty for my liking. A bit more of that almost Candy Idaho 7 fruitiness on the end but Sabro is only a light presence. Good but not the stellar hop treat I was expecting.",madmitch76

Shepherd Neame India Pale Ale (Bottle),4.1,Shepherd Neame,"Faversham, Kent","500ml bottle brewed in England at 6.1%. Clear metallic amber bronze, with a large, solid head. Aroma of caramel and slight earth. Lowish+ carbonation. Classic earthy Fuggles with a splash of citrus and apple. Fairly well-hopped for its supermarket price point, but won't really please someone looking for an American-style IPA! Pale caramel malt joins and completes the affair. Really not bad, for all its simplicity. It's not quite Fuller's Bengal Lancer, but then again, it's not pretending to be, and is a fair bit cheaper too. This is sort of the English equivalent of classic German beer, just...English, and ale. Has that typical Shepherd Neame taste to it. Fans of the brewery will like this, as will most who give it a fair shot. If you don't like Shepherd Neame style beers, though, you won't like this.",LagerGuide122

Let's just try to keep this in perspective. This pours pretty regularly, a slightly hazy brassy color under a foamy head. Smell is mostly hop bitterness. Any impressions from fresh northwestern hops would have dissipated, but what's left behind is still pretty hoppy. 
Taste is stuck on basic hop bitterness. The malt shows a very faint note of phenol, so that's what's been most affected by a long sit on the shelf. Still, a good version of an APA. Just need to get a chance at one that's fresher.",DrnkMcDermott

Lion Bridge Gazprom Double Maple,4.2,Lion Bridge Brewing Company,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa","12oz can from Windsor Hy-Vee, in a Sam Smith pint glass. Potent, unmistakable Pancake House syrupy smell at arm's length, with malted milk balls, something sort of marshmallowy, caramel, vanilla, wood smoke, candied plums and light roast. Awesome awesome. Pours oily black with one finger of creamy chocolate head that dissolves to a thin cover in a few minutes. Complex flavor profile that evolves from one sip to the next: Big hit of maple up front with chocolate and caramel around the mid-palate, long finish with ripe fruit and medium-roast and a flash of heat as the big ABV hits bottom. Full-bodied, but easier to drink than you'd think at first, sweet and sticky on the gums and back of the throat as you'd expect. Managed to get my hands on this unexpectedly just about a month after I tried its little brother, and I'm sure glad I did. The two experiences couldn't be more different. Double Maple is a big beer, and quite sweet, and although the maple is a consistent throughout, the other flavors fluctuate in surprising ways I associate with some of the best stouts out there. I'm really enjoying this one. Cheers Lion Bridge! To your health!",saltyseadog

Hazy golden orange body, small fizzy head turns into avspotty cover that leaves streaky lacing. Citrus and dank fight it out for control of the aroma, but its a tie. Taste favors the herbal, grassy, dank hops and the fruity citrus in the aroma turns into citrus peel. Overtly bitter all the way through the finish, subdued sweetness and light floral notes.",stevoj
Backcountry Three Stacks of High Society,3.9,Backcountry Brewing (BC),"Squamish, British Columbia","473mL can, pours an opaque cloudy orange with a large foamy white head. Aroma brings out a wonderful white wine tang from the Nelson, with citrus hops, pine, and biscuity malt. Flavour is really juicy, with lots of piney hops, tropical fruit, lots of juiciness, and light tanginess. Juicy as hell, with just enough of pine. Not too yeasty or chewy. Delicious.",mcberko

Kombrewcha Berry Hibiscus Hard Kombucha,3.2,Kombrewcha,"Brooklyn, New York","Plain label.  Hazy blood red pour.  Berries and hibiscus in the nose.  It does not taste sour and probiotic like most kombucha.  Instead, it is fruity and sweet, with a slight herbal undertone.  There is plenty of natural blackberry flavor, and it is certified organic with no added flavorings.  This is not a manly man's brew, but it might be nice on summer's day.",Slipstream

Steel & Oak / Twin Sails Natural Charm,3.0,Steel & Oak Brewing,"New Westminster, British Columbia","Very little foam, pours thick copper clear without visible carbonation. The aroma is huge floral candyish cherry, that's probably the bourbon mixing with the lager hops and not really doing a very good job of differentiating themselves. Flavour is a good balance of bourbon with very vague lager notes behind it. The bourbon works well on the tongue and there's a dry finish, but the aroma doesn't seem to jive to it. Otherwise still smooth and decently drinkable.",DeanF
